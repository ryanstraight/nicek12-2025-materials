## A Note on "Partnership" Language

We use "partnership" language deliberately. Industry professionals typically say they "use AI tools," but research on human-technology relations reveals that this framing obscures the mutual shaping between human judgment and automated systems. In security operations, the monitoring system shapes what counts as "suspicious" before the analyst ever sees it; the analyst's perception is mediated by tool design; agency is distributed across the analyst, the tool, and those who configured its detection logic.

Teaching students to see these relationships clearly—rather than through the "I use tools" framing—is part of developing cybersecurity expertise.

### Elementary (K-5)

::: {.callout-tip}
## Recommended First Activity

**[Activity 1: Security Detective Teams](../activities/01-security-detective-teams/)** (K-2: "[Mystery Helpers](../activities/01-security-detective-teams/k2.qmd)" or 3-5: "[Locked Library Computers](../activities/01-security-detective-teams/grades-3-5.qmd)")

This activity introduces the core partnership concept through investigation scenarios. Students discover that AI excels at pattern recognition while humans contribute contextual understanding, and that together they can solve problems neither could address alone.
:::

| Grade Band | First Activity | Time Needed | Prerequisites |
|------------|---------------|-------------|---------------|
| **K-2** | [Mystery Helpers](../activities/01-security-detective-teams/k2.qmd) | 20-25 min | None—designed for first exposure |
| **3-5** | [Locked Library Computers](../activities/01-security-detective-teams/grades-3-5.qmd) | 30-35 min | Basic understanding of school computer use |

**After completing Activity 1**, consider:

- **[Activity 2](../activities/02-ethics-automated-security/)** (Ethics): [Robot Helper Rules](../activities/02-ethics-automated-security/k2.qmd) (K-2) or [Computer Rules Committee](../activities/02-ethics-automated-security/grades-3-5.qmd) (3-5)
- **[Activity 3](../activities/03-ai-incident-response/)** (Incident Response): [Fix It Team!](../activities/03-ai-incident-response/k2.qmd) (K-2) or [Computer Problem Solvers](../activities/03-ai-incident-response/grades-3-5.qmd) (3-5)

### Middle School (6-8)

::: {.callout-tip}
## Recommended First Activity

**[Activity 1: Security Detective Teams](../activities/01-security-detective-teams/grades-6-8.qmd)** (45-50 minutes)

Middle school students benefit from completing the full investigation experience before engaging with ethics or incident response content. The detective framing captures student interest while establishing the foundational partnership concept.
:::

| Sequence | Activity | Time Needed | Prerequisites |
|----------|----------|-------------|---------------|
| **Start here** | [Security Detective Teams](../activities/01-security-detective-teams/grades-6-8.qmd) | 45-50 min | None |
| **Then** | [AI-Assisted Incident Response](../activities/03-ai-incident-response/grades-6-8.qmd) | 50-60 min | Partnership concept from Activity 1 |
| **Finally** | [Ethics in Automated Security](../activities/02-ethics-automated-security/grades-6-8.qmd) | 45-55 min | Activities 1 & 2 recommended |

Full implementation: ~2.5 hours across three class periods

Minimum viable path: Activity 1 alone delivers core partnership learning in a single period

### High School (9-12)

::: {.callout-tip}
## Recommended First Activity

**[Activity 1: Threat Investigation](../activities/01-security-detective-teams/grades-9-12.qmd)** (50-60 minutes)

The Security Operations Center (SOC) simulation provides authentic technical depth. For Career and Technical Education cybersecurity programs, this activity mirrors professional practice and aligns with [NICE Framework](https://niccs.cisa.gov/workforce-development/nice-framework) work roles.
:::

| Sequence | Activity | Time Needed | Prerequisites |
|----------|----------|-------------|---------------|
| **Start here** | [Threat Investigation](../activities/01-security-detective-teams/grades-9-12.qmd) | 50-60 min | Basic network concepts helpful |
| **Then** | [SOC Analyst Simulation](../activities/03-ai-incident-response/grades-9-12.qmd) | 55-60 min | Partnership concept from Activity 1 |
| **Finally** | [AI Governance Workshop](../activities/02-ethics-automated-security/grades-9-12.qmd) | 50-60 min | Activities 1 & 2 for full context |

**Full implementation**: ~3 hours across three class periods

**CTE/Advanced pathway**: All three activities form a coherent unit on professional human-AI collaboration

## Implementation Time Planning

### Single Class Period

Select **one activity** at your grade level. [Activity 1 (Security Detective Teams)](../activities/01-security-detective-teams/) is recommended for initial implementation because it introduces the partnership concept that serves as the foundation for all subsequent activities.

| Grade Band | Activity 1 Duration | Includes |
|------------|---------------------|----------|
| K-2 | 20-25 minutes | Introduction, investigation, debrief |
| 3-5 | 30-35 minutes | Introduction, investigation, synthesis |
| 6-8 | 45-50 minutes | Full investigation cycle + debrief |
| 9-12 | 50-60 minutes | SOC simulation + career connections |

### Two Class Periods

Pair Activities 1 and 3 for a two-session sequence. [Activity 3 (Incident Response)](../activities/03-ai-incident-response/) applies the partnership concept to time-sensitive scenarios, extending naturally from the investigative work in Activity 1.

### Three Class Periods (Full Curriculum)

Implement all three activities in sequence:

1. **[Security Detective Teams](../activities/01-security-detective-teams/)** — Introduces the partnership concept
2. **[AI-Assisted Incident Response](../activities/03-ai-incident-response/)** — Applies partnership principles to crisis situations
3. **[Ethics in Automated Security](../activities/02-ethics-automated-security/)** — Examines governance implications

This sequence develops progressively sophisticated understanding of human-AI collaboration in cybersecurity contexts.

## Technology Assessment

Before beginning instruction, assess your classroom's level of AI access:

| You Have | Your Approach |
|----------|---------------|
| **1:1 devices + student AI accounts** | Students partner directly with AI |
| **Shared devices + class AI account** | Rotation stations + demonstrations |
| **Teacher device + projector only** | Think-Aloud Demonstration |
| **Home access, no school access** | Homework preparation + class synthesis |
| **No devices or AI access** | Pre-generated response cards + teacher role-play |

::: {.callout-note}
## Every Approach Works

Low-resource options frequently produce richer learning outcomes than live AI access. When students cannot defer to AI for immediate answers, discussion depth and critical thinking often increase. See the [Low-Resource Implementation Guide](low-resource-implementation.qmd) for detailed strategies.
