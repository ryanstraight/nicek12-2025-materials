New to this approach? Start with these three:

1. **Adams & Thompson (2016)** — Practical heuristics for posthuman inquiry in education
2. **Newhouse et al. (2017)** — The NICE Framework foundation document
3. **CYBER.org Standards** — K-12 cybersecurity learning progressions

## Why "Partnership" Language? {#why-partnership}

Industry professionals typically say they "use AI tools." We deliberately chose different language—and understanding why matters for teaching.

### The Problem with "Tool Use" Framing

When we say "I use a tool," we imply:

- The human is fully in control
- The tool is passive until activated
- Agency flows one direction: human → tool
- The human remains unchanged by the interaction

But this isn't what actually happens in cybersecurity operations.

### What's Really Happening in a SOC

Consider a Security Operations Center analyst working with a SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) system:

1. **The SIEM shapes perception** — Before the analyst sees anything, the system has already decided what counts as "suspicious." Thousands of events are filtered, correlated, and prioritized. The analyst's awareness is bounded by what the tool surfaces.

2. **The analyst adapts to the tool** — Experienced analysts learn to "think like the SIEM"—understanding its detection logic, anticipating its blind spots, structuring their investigations around its capabilities.

3. **Agency is distributed** — When a threat is detected, who found it? The analyst who investigated? The SIEM that flagged it? The rule-writer who configured the detection? The answer is: the assemblage of all of them together.

4. **Neither succeeds alone** — The SIEM can't understand context, institutional knowledge, or human factors. The analyst can't process millions of log entries. Together, they accomplish what neither could individually.

### Why This Matters for Education

Teaching students that they "use AI tools" sets up a false mental model that will fail them in professional practice. They'll either:

- **Over-rely on AI** (assuming it "handles" security while they "use" it)
- **Under-utilize AI** (treating it as a simple lookup tool rather than an investigative partner)
- **Miss the mutual shaping** (not recognizing how AI recommendations influence their perception)

The "partnership" framing we use throughout these activities isn't merely aspirational—it's preparation for the actual cognitive work of modern cybersecurity operations.

### Theoretical Foundation

This approach draws from **posthuman educational theory**, particularly:

- **Rosi Braidotti's** work on human-technology entanglement and distributed agency
- **Catherine Adams and Terrie Lynn Thompson's** practical heuristics for examining how digital technologies shape human perception and practice—what they call "interviewing" digital objects to understand their contributions to our work

These theoretical insights translate directly into developing cybersecurity expertise. When students learn to see AI as a partner with distinct capabilities, limitations, and influence on their own thinking, they're developing the meta-cognitive awareness that distinguishes expert practitioners.

## How to Use These Resources

### For Curriculum Development

Start with the **CYBER.org Standards** and **NICE Framework** to establish learning objectives, then draw on the pedagogical research to inform activity design.

### For Grant Writing

The workforce development references (Hoffman et al., ISC² reports) provide evidence for program justification. The educational research supports methodology choices.

### For Theoretical Grounding

If you're writing about or presenting on these activities, the posthuman/collaboration literature (Adams & Thompson, Braidotti, Luckin & Cukurova) provides scholarly context for the human-AI partnership framing.

### For Practical Implementation

The hands-on learning resources (Catota et al., Mitnick & Simon) offer concrete guidance for structuring technology-based learning experiences.
