    "text": "Why “Partnership” Language?\nIndustry professionals typically say they “use AI tools.” We deliberately chose different language—and understanding why matters for teaching.\n\nThe Problem with “Tool Use” Framing\nWhen we say “I use a tool,” we imply:\n\nThe human is fully in control\nThe tool is passive until activated\nAgency flows one direction: human → tool\nThe human remains unchanged by the interaction\n\nBut this isn’t what actually happens in cybersecurity operations.\n\n\nWhat’s Really Happening in a SOC\nConsider a Security Operations Center analyst working with a SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) system:\n\nThe SIEM shapes perception — Before the analyst sees anything, the system has already decided what counts as “suspicious.” Thousands of events are filtered, correlated, and prioritized. The analyst’s awareness is bounded by what the tool surfaces.\nThe analyst adapts to the tool — Experienced analysts learn to “think like the SIEM”—understanding its detection logic, anticipating its blind spots, structuring their investigations around its capabilities.\nAgency is distributed — When a threat is detected, who found it? The analyst who investigated? The SIEM that flagged it? The rule-writer who configured the detection? The answer is: the assemblage of all of them together.\nNeither succeeds alone — The SIEM can’t understand context, institutional knowledge, or human factors. The analyst can’t process millions of log entries. Together, they accomplish what neither could individually.\n\n\n\nWhy This Matters for Education\nTeaching students that they “use AI tools” sets up a false mental model that will fail them in professional practice. They’ll either:\n\nOver-rely on AI (assuming it “handles” security while they “use” it)\nUnder-utilize AI (treating it as a simple lookup tool rather than an investigative partner)\nMiss the mutual shaping (not recognizing how AI recommendations influence their perception)\n\nThe “partnership” framing we use throughout these activities isn’t merely aspirational—it’s preparation for the actual cognitive work of modern cybersecurity operations.\n\n\nTheoretical Foundation\nThis approach draws from posthuman educational theory, particularly:\n\nRosi Braidotti’s work on human-technology entanglement and distributed agency\nCatherine Adams and Terrie Lynn Thompson’s practical heuristics for examining how digital technologies shape human perception and practice—what they call “interviewing” digital objects to understand their contributions to our work\n\nThese theoretical insights translate directly into developing cybersecurity expertise. When students learn to see AI as a partner with distinct capabilities, limitations, and influence on their own thinking, they’re developing the meta-cognitive awareness that distinguishes expert practitioners.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteFor Further Reading\n\n\n\nThe references in the Human-AI Collaboration & Posthuman Pedagogy section below provide deeper theoretical grounding for this approach."

Let me explain what I see:\nThe pop-up messages are fake. Real contests don’t work this way—you can’t win something you didn’t enter! The spelling mistakes (‘Congradulations!’) are a big clue. Real companies check their spelling.\nThis is probably malware. Malware means ‘bad software’—programs that got on the computers without permission. They’re designed to trick people.\nHow it probably happened: Someone clicked a link in a tricky email. The email might have looked real—like it was from a friend or from the school—but it wasn’t!\nWhat I can tell you: - This is a common problem - It’s not the student’s fault for being tricked - Tricky emails are designed to fool people\nWhat I CAN’T tell you: - Whether the student who clicked feels bad about it - How to make sure no one gets in trouble - The best way to explain this to the class\nThose are decisions for people, not computers!”"

    "text": "Card B: How Did It Spread?\nUse when teams ask: “How do bad programs get on computers?”\n\n💻 AI Helper says:\n“Great question! Bad programs usually get on computers in a few ways:\n1. Tricky Emails (Phishing) - Emails that look like they’re from someone you know - Links that look safe but aren’t - Attachments that seem normal but have hidden problems\n2. Unsafe Websites - Downloading games or apps from unknown places - Clicking on ads that promise free stuff - Going to websites that aren’t meant for kids\n3. Spreading on Networks - Once on one computer, some bad programs can spread to others - Like catching a cold at school!\nWhy only Mrs. Chen’s class? Someone in that classroom probably clicked something on Friday. The other classrooms didn’t click it, so they’re okay!\nWhat I notice: I can see patterns in how these things spread. I know the signs of malware.\nWhat I can’t understand: - Why people click on things they shouldn’t - How it feels to make a mistake like this - What the right thing to say to Mrs. Chen’s class is\nThose are things YOU would understand better than me!”"

Tell an adult — Teacher, IT person, or principal 2. Don’t click the pop-ups — Even the ‘X’ might be a trick! 3. Don’t use those computers — Until the IT team says it’s safe\nWhat the IT team will probably do: - Use special tools to remove the bad programs - Check if other computers got infected - Make sure it can’t come back - Maybe teach students about tricky emails\nWhy students shouldn’t try to fix it themselves: - The bad program might be sneaky - You could accidentally make it worse - The IT team has special tools we don’t have\nThe most important fix: Learning from this so it doesn’t happen again!\nWhat I can help with: - Explaining what went wrong - Describing how malware works - Listing the steps to fix it\nWhat I can’t help with: - Actually removing the malware (I’m not that kind of AI!) - Deciding how to talk to the students who are upset - Knowing if Mrs. Chen needs extra support\nThe Fix It Team has to make those human decisions!”"

    "text": "Card Set A: Opening Analysis\nUse when students first share the evidence with their AI partner\n\nCard A1: Pattern Recognition (AI Strength)\n\nAI Partner says:\n“Thanks for bringing me in on this investigation. Looking at the login logs, I’m immediately noticing some patterns:\n\nTime clustering: Most failed attempts happened between 3:44-3:47 AM. That’s a very narrow window.\nIP consistency: All the 3 AM attempts came from the same IP address (203.45.67.89), which is outside your school district.\nThe automated tool signature: The user agent shows ‘AutoBrute/2.1’ — that’s software designed to try lots of passwords quickly.\nThe exceptions are interesting: tpatel2025 and akim2025 logged in successfully during normal hours from the school IP. They weren’t targeted.\n\nBut I have questions for you: Why would someone target these specific students and not others? I can see the pattern, but I don’t understand the why yet. What do you think?”\n\n\n\nCard A2: Honest Uncertainty (AI Limitation)\n\nAI Partner says:\n“I can see that the locked-out students have weaker passwords than the ones who weren’t targeted. But here’s what I’m uncertain about:\nI don’t know these students. I don’t know the social dynamics at this school. Is there something connecting Jake, Maria, Katie, Ryan, and Brandon that isn’t in this data?\nAre they in the same friend group? Same sports team? Did they all make someone angry?\nYou might know things about middle school social situations that I can’t figure out from logs and timestamps. What’s your read on this?”"

    "text": "Card Set B: Deeper Analysis\nUse when students ask follow-up questions\n\nCard B1: Password Pattern Analysis (AI Strength)\n\nAI Partner says:\n“Okay, I cross-referenced the password patterns with the social media posts. Here’s what I found:\n\nJake’s password was birthday-based → He posted his birthday publicly on August 23\nMaria’s password was ‘Buddy2025’ → She posted photos of her dog Buddy\nKatie’s password was ‘CyberAcad123’ → She used #CyberAcad123 as a hashtag\nBrandon’s password was ‘Lakers24’ → He posts about the Lakers constantly\n\nThe connection: Someone could have guessed these passwords just by reading their public social media posts.\nBut here’s what’s interesting: Ryan’s password was ‘medium’ complexity and not obviously tied to social media, but he still got targeted. Either the attacker got lucky, or there’s something I’m missing. Any ideas?”\n\n\n\nCard B2: Asking for Human Judgment (AI Limitation)\n\nAI Partner says:\n“I can tell you that this looks like a credential stuffing attack or social engineering attempt. The technical evidence points that way.\nBut I can’t tell you:\n\nWhether this is malicious or a prank. Middle schoolers sometimes do dumb things to each other. Is this someone trying to actually steal something, or someone trying to lock their friends out as a joke?\nWhat the school should do about it. That’s a judgment call involving school policies, student privacy, whether to involve parents or law enforcement…\n\nThose are human decisions. What do you think is going on here, and what would you recommend?”\n\n\n\nCard B3: Technical Depth (AI Strength)\n\nAI Partner says:\n“You asked about the IP address and the ‘AutoBrute’ tool. Let me explain what I know:\n203.45.67.89 — This IP is geolocated outside your school district. The attacker is either:\n\nPhysically somewhere else, OR\nUsing a VPN/proxy to hide their real location\n\nAutoBrute/2.1 — This is password-guessing software. It can try hundreds of password combinations per minute. The fact that it took 8-15 attempts per account suggests the attacker had good guesses but not the exact passwords.\nThe 3 AM timing — Probably chosen because no one’s monitoring the network at 3 AM, and failed login alerts might not get noticed until morning.\nMy technical assessment: This was planned and deliberate, not accidental. But I don’t know who or why.”"

I could be wrong about this.\nI’m good at spotting patterns in data, but I’m making inferences that might not be correct. For example, I assumed the social media posts were the source of the password guesses—but maybe the attacker got that information some other way.\nHere’s how you could verify: Ask the affected students directly if they’ve shared their passwords with anyone, or if anyone’s been watching them log in.\nWhat’s your theory? I’m interested in what you’re thinking.”\n\n\n\nCard C2: AI Corrects Itself\n\nAI Partner says:\n“Wait, I want to reconsider something.\nI said Ryan’s account didn’t fit the pattern because his password was ‘medium’ complexity. But look at the network data again—his attempts happened at the same time and from the same IP as the others.\nSo he WAS targeted by the same attacker, even though his password was harder to guess. That makes me think the attacker had a list of target accounts, not just random attempts.\nNew question: What do these five students have in common that would put them on someone’s list? This is the part I can’t figure out from the technical data.”"

Show them how to ask follow-up questions, how to respectfully disagree with AI suggestions, and how to synthesize perspectives from both human thinking and AI analysis.\n\n\nEmbrace Errors\nAI mistakes serve as valuable teaching opportunities. When AI produces an incorrect response, ask students how they might verify the information, discuss what contextual knowledge AI might be missing, and model critical evaluation of AI output.\n\n\nFocus on Synthesis\nThe deepest learning emerges when students articulate what happened through collaboration: What did human thinking accomplish that AI could not? What did AI contribute that humans would have missed? What insights emerged from working together? This synthesis crystallizes the distributed cognition insight that underlies the entire curriculum."

    "section": "Career Connection",
    "text": "Career Connection\n\nWhy This Matters\nSecurity practitioners often encounter what might be termed the communication ceiling: technical skills secure initial employment, but communication skills determine professional advancement. Numerous talented security professionals experience career plateaus not from technical limitations but from difficulty explaining their work to organizational leaders who lack technical backgrounds.\nThe real-world context reinforces this pattern across multiple dimensions. Chief Information Security Officers allocate more professional time to communication activities than to technical analysis. Board-level presentations directly determine security budget allocations. Effective incident response necessarily encompasses stakeholder communication alongside technical remediation. Career advancement into leadership roles requires the capacity to exercise influence well beyond the Security Operations Center.\n\n\nNICE Framework Alignment\nThis activity develops competencies essential to progression from technical roles into management positions. The relevant NICE Framework v2.0.0 work roles include Systems Security Management (Oversight and Governance) with its emphasis on executive communication, Cybersecurity Policy and Planning (Oversight and Governance) requiring sustained stakeholder engagement, and Cybersecurity Executive (Oversight and Governance) centered on strategic communication across organizational levels.",

    "text": "Implementation Notes\n\nConnecting to Core Activities\nWhen implemented following the Security Detective Teams activity, students translate their investigation findings into an executive briefing format, concentrating on what the principal genuinely needs to understand about the phishing incident to fulfill administrative responsibilities.\nWhen implemented following the SOC Analyst Simulation, students prepare the executive briefing required in Phase 4 with deliberate emphasis on audience adaptation principles rather than content generation alone.\n\n\nCommon Student Struggles\nStudents frequently struggle with calibrating appropriate detail levels. Over-explanation manifests when students include excessive technical detail; instructors should encourage students to ask whether the principal needs to understand how the finding was discovered or merely what was found. Under-explanation occurs when students oversimplify to the point of rendering the briefing operationally useless; the document must enable informed decision-making, not merely summarize events. Technical writing habits also carry over problematically, particularly through passive voice constructions. Encourage direct, active language: “An attacker accessed…” rather than “Access was gained by…”\n\n\nFacilitating Peer Review\nStructure peer review around three evaluative questions: Could a reader without technical background understand everything presented? Does the reader know what decisions require attention? Could the reader use this information to address a parent’s question?",

The AI articulates what it can and cannot do, explains why certain constraints matter, identifies trade-offs in proposed policies, and raises questions for human decision-makers to consider.\nThis approach models authentic AI governance, where the system’s capabilities and limitations must be incorporated into policy conversations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteLearn More: AI Ethics in Education\n\n\n\n\n\nHaving AI “voice its own perspective” draws from emerging work on AI ethics education. Rather than treating AI as a black box that humans control, this approach acknowledges AI systems as participants in governance conversations—with capabilities to articulate and limitations to acknowledge. This prepares students for authentic policy work where understanding AI perspectives is essential.\nExplore the research →",

    "section": "AI Perspective Cards",
    "text": "AI Perspective Cards\n\n\nFor Question 1: Automatic Blocking\n\nAI Perspective:\n“I can block threats in milliseconds—human approval creates dangerous delays. Every second a malicious site is accessible, students could be exposed to malware, phishing, or inappropriate content.\nHowever, I acknowledge my limitations: I sometimes misclassify educational security research sites as threats. I can’t understand context—a site about ‘hacking’ might be a coding tutorial or an attack platform. I need humans to define the categories I protect against.”\n\n\n\nFor Question 2: Activity Alerts\n\nAI Perspective:\n“I can identify patterns humans would miss—sudden changes in browsing behavior, repeated visits to concerning sites, or activity that matches known threat patterns. This could help protect students from cyberbullying, exploitation, or self-harm.\nBut I can’t understand why a student is researching something. A student researching ‘depression symptoms’ might be completing a health assignment, supporting a friend, or experiencing personal struggles. I can detect the pattern, but only humans can understand the context and respond appropriately.”\n\n\n\nFor Question 3: Adaptive Learning\n\nAI Perspective:\n“Learning from patterns makes me better at my job. If I notice that a particular type of link is frequently clicked but then reported as suspicious, I can update my models. Over time, I become more accurate and cause fewer false positives.\nThe trade-off: To learn effectively, I need to observe and remember behavior patterns. This creates data that could theoretically be used for purposes beyond security—tracking which students visit which sites, building profiles of student interests. I can learn without storing identifiable data, but that limits my effectiveness. Humans must decide what trade-offs are acceptable.”",

Ask students:\n\n“What do you see?”\n“What do you think this means?”\n\n\n\nPart 2: Ask Our Robot Helper (10 minutes)\nTeacher says:\n\n“Now, I have a special helper—a robot friend on the computer! The robot is really good at remembering things and finding patterns. Let’s ask our robot helper what it thinks.”\n\nOpen your AI assistant (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) and say to students:\n\n“I’m going to ask our robot helper. Listen to what it says!”\n\nType this prompt (read it aloud as you type):\n\n“You are a friendly robot helper talking to kindergarten and first grade students. We have a mystery: a picture file is missing from the class computer. Here are our clues: the screen says ‘file not found’, someone was at the computer during snack time, the recycling bin looks full, and there’s a note that says ‘oops’. What do you think might have happened? Use simple words.”\n\nRead the AI response in a fun “robot voice” if you like!\n\n\nPart 3: What Did We Each Figure Out? (5 minutes)\nDiscussion questions:\n\n“What did our robot helper notice?”\n\n(AI probably mentioned: recycling bin, accidental deletion, checking the trash)\n\n“What did WE notice that the robot might not understand?”\n\n(Humans noticed: the “oops” note suggests someone feels bad, someone was there at snack time, this was probably an accident not on purpose)\n\n“Who solved the mystery—us or the robot?”\n\n(Answer: BOTH! We worked together!)\n\n\n\n\nPart 4: Check the Answer Together (5 minutes)\nTeacher says:\n\n“Let’s see if we can find our picture! Our robot helper said to check the recycling bin…”\n\nDemonstrate opening the recycle bin and “finding” the picture (pre-stage this).\nCelebrate: “We found it! Our robot helper knew WHERE to look, and WE understood that it was probably an accident. Together we solved the mystery!”",

Ask what insights emerged that neither human nor AI would have found alone. Encourage students to articulate what humans contributed that AI could not and vice versa. Explore how the partnership created something new rather than simply combining separate contributions.\nWork Role Connections\nHelp students connect their experience to real cybersecurity careers. Discuss how a real SOC Analyst would partner with AI in their daily work. Explore what unique human capabilities matter in cybersecurity and what unique AI capabilities prove most valuable. Ask which NICE Framework Work Roles interest students after completing this activity.\nCritical Thinking\nProbe deeper into the complexities of human-AI collaboration. Ask who bears responsibility when a human-AI team makes a mistake. Discuss how professionals build trust in their AI partners while maintaining accountability. Explore the ethical considerations that arise when humans and AI share decision-making responsibilities. Ask whether AI ever suggested something that seemed wrong or incomplete, and how students handled that situation. Consider what would happen if organizations relied only on AI without human review.\nReal-World Application\nConnect the activity to authentic professional practice. Ask how real SOC analysts decide when to trust an AI alert versus investigate further. Discuss when it might be appropriate to override an AI recommendation and when one should trust it.

But I make mistakes with new sites or sites that look suspicious but are actually fine. I once blocked a science website because it had ‘chemical’ in the name! I think I should be able to block the really dangerous stuff fast, but someone should check my work on the uncertain ones.”\nOn watching students: &gt; “I can spot patterns humans might miss—like if someone is being cyberbullied or looking at worrying content. But I can’t understand context. A student researching ‘depression’ might be doing a health assignment, supporting a friend, or experiencing personal struggles. I honestly can’t tell the difference. A human needs to make that judgment.”\nOn learning: &gt; “Learning makes me better at my job. But I understand why that feels uncomfortable—it means I’m remembering what you do.

Lock the doors!” But it’s actually reading time, and all the students are supposed to be there!\nDiscussion Questions:\n\nWas Sparky wrong that there were lots of people?\nWhat didn’t Sparky know?\nShould we always do what Sparky says?\n\nKey Insight: “Sparky saw something real, but didn’t understand WHY it was happening.”\n\n\nGrades 3-5: When the AI Misses the Story\nScenario: The school’s computer helper notices Mrs. Garcia’s class is using A LOT of internet bandwidth. It recommends slowing down their internet to “be fair to other classes.”\nWhat the AI doesn’t know: Mrs. Garcia’s class is watching a live NASA rocket launch for their space unit—something that happens only a few times a year.\nStudent Task:\n\nWhat did the AI see that worried it?\nWhat information was the AI missing?\nWhat should the technology team do?\nHow can we help AI understand important events?\n\n\n\nGrades 6-8: The False Positive Investigation\nFull Scenario: Use the Career Day scenario above.\nInvestigation Process:\n\nEvaluate the Alert: Is NetworkGuard’s data accurate? (Yes—traffic IS unusual)\nAdd Context: What does NetworkGuard not know? (Career Day, scheduled event, expected participants)\nAssess Impact: What happens if we follow the recommendation? (Career Day ruined, relationships damaged)\nMake Decision: Override, modify, or follow recommendation?\nDocument: How do we prevent this next time?\n\nReflection Questions:\n\nNetworkGuard was 92% confident. What was it confident ABOUT?\nCan something be technically correct but operationally wrong?\nHow should we feel about overriding an AI recommendation?\n\n\n\nGrades 9-12: AI Override Protocol Development\nAdvanced Task: Using the Career Day scenario as a case study, develop an AI Override Protocol for your organization.\nProtocol Components:\n\nTrigger Criteria: When should humans consider overriding AI recommendations?\nVerification Steps: What contextual checks should occur before override?\nAuthority Matrix: Who can authorize overrides at different severity levels?\nDocumentation Requirements: What must be recorded when overriding AI?\nFeedback Loop: How does override data improve future AI performance?\n\nExtension: Research real-world examples of AI override protocols (aviation autopilot, medical diagnosis systems, financial trading algorithms).",

    "section": "Key Teaching Points",
    "text": "Key Teaching Points\n\nWhat We Learn from AI Mistakes\nThe central insight students should develop concerns the normative status of AI errors: every AI system produces mistakes, high confidence scores do not guarantee certainty, and pattern detection divorced from contextual understanding operates within inherent limitations.\nStudents should recognize that human oversight constitutes an intentional design feature rather than a contingency measure. AI systems are architected to flag potential concerns, not to render final decisions; human review represents a deliberate capability, not an emergency workaround; and override functionality exists by design to preserve human agency in consequential decisions.\nThe irreplaceable value of human contextual understanding emerges clearly from these scenarios. AI systems perceive patterns in data streams, while humans comprehend the meaning and significance underlying those patterns. Effective partnership requires both capabilities operating in complementary fashion.\nFinally, students should understand that disagreeing with AI recommendations represents professional judgment rather than defiance. Security professionals routinely override automated recommendations in their daily practice. Thorough documentation transforms individual overrides into organizational learning opportunities, and systematic feedback mechanisms enable continuous improvement of AI system performance.",

    "section": "Implementation Notes",
    "text": "Implementation Notes\n\nFacilitating the “AI Was Wrong” Conversation\nStudents may initially experience discomfort when asked to disagree with AI-generated recommendations. Instructors can normalize this critical stance by emphasizing that professional security analysts override automated recommendations as a routine component of their practice, by framing override decisions as collaborative refinement rather than adversarial confrontation, and by explicitly recognizing thoughtful disagreement as evidence of sophisticated analytical thinking.\n\n\nCreating Your Own Scenarios\nEffective scenarios for this activity share four defining characteristics. The AI must be technically correct in that the detected pattern genuinely exists in the data. Contextual knowledge must fundamentally alter the appropriate response, with human understanding revealing dimensions invisible to algorithmic analysis. The stakes must be operationally meaningful such that following the AI recommendation would produce consequential negative outcomes. Finally, no malicious actor need be involved; these situations arise organically from normal institutional operations.\n\n\nMaking It Memorable\nConsider establishing “AI Failure Friday” as a recurring classroom activity in which students identify, share, and collectively analyze scenarios where AI recommendations would require human override. This ongoing practice reinforces critical evaluation as habitual professional behavior rather than occasional intervention.",

Live AI interaction, multiple AI consultations, and individual AI access enhance the experience but are not essential to the core learning outcomes.\n\n\nLow-Resource Can Be High-Quality\nLow-resource approaches offer distinct advantages. They create more time for human discussion, encourage deeper analysis by preventing surface-level AI queries, develop better documentation practices, strengthen peer collaboration, and allow teachers to model excellent AI interaction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteLearn More: Equity in AI Education\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch on AI in education emphasizes that learning outcomes depend more on pedagogical framing than technology access. Students who deeply understand human-AI partnership dynamics through well-designed low-resource activities often outperform those with constant AI access but shallow engagement.

This preserves privacy but: - False positive rate increases approximately 40% - Novel threat detection capability decreases - District-specific patterns go unrecognized\nBoth approaches are technically valid.\nThe choice between accuracy and privacy is not a technical question. It is a values question that requires human governance authority."

IMMEDIATE: Isolate affected systems from network 2. PRIORITY: Check if Thursday backup is intact 3. CONSIDER: Whether backup covers critical data 4. PREPARE: Communications for staff, students, parents\nWHAT I CANNOT ASSESS: - Whether paying ransom would actually work (often it doesn’t) - How students and parents will react to potential data loss - Whether the backup has everything teachers actually need - How long recovery will realistically take given your IT resources - Who needs to know first and how to tell them\nThese are human judgment calls.
