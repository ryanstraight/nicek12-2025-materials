    "text": "Why “Partnership” Language?\nIndustry professionals typically say they “use AI tools.” We deliberately chose different language—and understanding why matters for teaching.\n\nThe Problem with “Tool Use” Framing\nWhen we say “I use a tool,” we imply:\n\nThe human is fully in control\nThe tool is passive until activated\nAgency flows one direction: human → tool\nThe human remains unchanged by the interaction\n\nBut this isn’t what actually happens in cybersecurity operations.\n\n\nWhat’s Really Happening in a SOC\nConsider a Security Operations Center analyst working with a SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) system:\n\nThe SIEM shapes perception — Before the analyst sees anything, the system has already decided what counts as “suspicious.” Thousands of events are filtered, correlated, and prioritized. The analyst’s awareness is bounded by what the tool surfaces.\nThe analyst adapts to the tool — Experienced analysts learn to “think like the SIEM”—understanding its detection logic, anticipating its blind spots, structuring their investigations around its capabilities.\nAgency is distributed — When a threat is detected, who found it? The analyst who investigated? The SIEM that flagged it? The rule-writer who configured the detection? The answer is: the assemblage of all of them together.\nNeither succeeds alone — The SIEM can’t understand context, institutional knowledge, or human factors. The analyst can’t process millions of log entries. Together, they accomplish what neither could individually.\n\n\n\nWhy This Matters for Education\nTeaching students that they “use AI tools” sets up a false mental model that will fail them in professional practice. They’ll either:\n\nOver-rely on AI (assuming it “handles” security while they “use” it)\nUnder-utilize AI (treating it as a simple lookup tool rather than an investigative partner)\nMiss the mutual shaping (not recognizing how AI recommendations influence their perception)\n\nThe “partnership” framing we use throughout these activities isn’t merely aspirational—it’s preparation for the actual cognitive work of modern cybersecurity operations.\n\n\nTheoretical Foundation\nThis approach draws from posthuman educational theory, particularly:\n\nRosi Braidotti’s work on human-technology entanglement and distributed agency\nCatherine Adams and Terrie Lynn Thompson’s practical heuristics for examining how digital technologies shape human perception and practice—what they call “interviewing” digital objects to understand their contributions to our work\n\nThese theoretical insights translate directly into developing cybersecurity expertise. When students learn to see AI as a partner with distinct capabilities, limitations, and influence on their own thinking, they’re developing the meta-cognitive awareness that distinguishes expert practitioners.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteFor Further Reading\n\n\n\nThe references in the Human-AI Collaboration & Posthuman Pedagogy section below provide deeper theoretical grounding for this approach."

Show them how to ask follow-up questions, how to respectfully disagree with AI suggestions, and how to synthesize perspectives from both human thinking and AI analysis.\n\n\nEmbrace Errors\nAI mistakes serve as valuable teaching opportunities. When AI produces an incorrect response, ask students how they might verify the information, discuss what contextual knowledge AI might be missing, and model critical evaluation of AI output.\n\n\nFocus on Synthesis\nThe deepest learning emerges when students articulate what happened through collaboration: What did human thinking accomplish that AI could not? What did AI contribute that humans would have missed? What insights emerged from working together? This synthesis crystallizes the distributed cognition insight that underlies the entire curriculum."

Numerous talented security professionals experience career plateaus not from technical limitations but from difficulty explaining their work to organizational leaders who lack technical backgrounds.\nThe real-world context reinforces this pattern across multiple dimensions. Chief Information Security Officers allocate more professional time to communication activities than to technical analysis. Board-level presentations directly determine security budget allocations. Effective incident response necessarily encompasses stakeholder communication alongside technical remediation. Career advancement into leadership roles requires the capacity to exercise influence well beyond the Security Operations Center.\n\n\nNICE Framework Alignment\nThis activity develops competencies essential to progression from technical roles into management positions. The relevant NICE Framework v2.0.0 work roles include Systems Security Management (Oversight and Governance) with its emphasis on executive communication, Cybersecurity Policy and Planning (Oversight and Governance) requiring sustained stakeholder engagement, and Cybersecurity Executive (Oversight and Governance) centered on strategic communication across organizational levels.",

    "text": "Implementation Notes\n\nConnecting to Core Activities\nWhen implemented following the Security Detective Teams activity, students translate their investigation findings into an executive briefing format, concentrating on what the principal genuinely needs to understand about the phishing incident to fulfill administrative responsibilities.\nWhen implemented following the SOC Analyst Simulation, students prepare the executive briefing required in Phase 4 with deliberate emphasis on audience adaptation principles rather than content generation alone.\n\n\nCommon Student Struggles\nStudents frequently struggle with calibrating appropriate detail levels. Over-explanation manifests when students include excessive technical detail; instructors should encourage students to ask whether the principal needs to understand how the finding was discovered or merely what was found. Under-explanation occurs when students oversimplify to the point of rendering the briefing operationally useless; the document must enable informed decision-making, not merely summarize events. Technical writing habits also carry over problematically, particularly through passive voice constructions. Encourage direct, active language: “An attacker accessed…” rather than “Access was gained by…”\n\n\nFacilitating Peer Review\nStructure peer review around three evaluative questions: Could a reader without technical background understand everything presented? Does the reader know what decisions require attention? Could the reader use this information to address a parent’s question?",

    "text": "Why AI Participates\nUnlike Activities 1 and 3 where AI serves primarily as an analytical partner, Activity 2 features the AI actively voicing its own perspective. The AI articulates what it can and cannot do, explains why certain constraints matter, identifies trade-offs in proposed policies, and raises questions for human decision-makers to consider.\nThis approach models authentic AI governance, where the system’s capabilities and limitations must be incorporated into policy conversations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteLearn More: AI Ethics in Education\n\n\n\n\n\nHaving AI “voice its own perspective” draws from emerging work on AI ethics education. Rather than treating AI as a black box that humans control, this approach acknowledges AI systems as participants in governance conversations—with capabilities to articulate and limitations to acknowledge. This prepares students for authentic policy work where understanding AI perspectives is essential.\nExplore the research →",

    "section": "AI Perspective Cards",
    "text": "AI Perspective Cards\n\n\nFor Question 1: Automatic Blocking\n\nAI Perspective:\n“I can block threats in milliseconds—human approval creates dangerous delays. Every second a malicious site is accessible, students could be exposed to malware, phishing, or inappropriate content.\nHowever, I acknowledge my limitations: I sometimes misclassify educational security research sites as threats. I can’t understand context—a site about ‘hacking’ might be a coding tutorial or an attack platform. I need humans to define the categories I protect against.”\n\n\n\nFor Question 2: Activity Alerts\n\nAI Perspective:\n“I can identify patterns humans would miss—sudden changes in browsing behavior, repeated visits to concerning sites, or activity that matches known threat patterns. This could help protect students from cyberbullying, exploitation, or self-harm.\nBut I can’t understand why a student is researching something. A student researching ‘depression symptoms’ might be completing a health assignment, supporting a friend, or experiencing personal struggles. I can detect the pattern, but only humans can understand the context and respond appropriately.”\n\n\n\nFor Question 3: Adaptive Learning\n\nAI Perspective:\n“Learning from patterns makes me better at my job. If I notice that a particular type of link is frequently clicked but then reported as suspicious, I can update my models. Over time, I become more accurate and cause fewer false positives.\nThe trade-off: To learn effectively, I need to observe and remember behavior patterns. This creates data that could theoretically be used for purposes beyond security—tracking which students visit which sites, building profiles of student interests. I can learn without storing identifiable data, but that limits my effectiveness. Humans must decide what trade-offs are acceptable.”",

The robot is really good at remembering things and finding patterns. Let’s ask our robot helper what it thinks.”\nOpen your AI assistant (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) and say to students: &gt; “I’m going to ask our robot helper. Listen to what it says!”\nType this prompt (read it aloud as you type): &gt; “You are a friendly robot helper talking to kindergarten and first grade students. We have a mystery: a picture file is missing from the class computer. Here are our clues: the screen says ‘file not found’, someone was at the computer during snack time, the recycling bin looks full, and there’s a note that says ‘oops’. What do you think might have happened? Use simple words.”\nRead the AI response in a fun “robot voice” if you like!\n\n\nPart 3: What Did We Each Figure Out?

Groups rotate through the AI station while others work on evidence analysis, maximizing limited technology resources.\nThink-Aloud Demonstration involves projecting a single AI interaction for the whole class, with everyone participating in analyzing the exchange. This strategy ensures all students engage with the AI partnership concept simultaneously.\nHomework Preparation leverages home AI access when students have it.

Ask what insights emerged that neither human nor AI would have found alone. Encourage students to articulate what humans contributed that AI could not and vice versa. Explore how the partnership created something new rather than simply combining separate contributions.\nWork Role Connections\nHelp students connect their experience to real cybersecurity careers. Discuss how a real SOC Analyst would partner with AI in their daily work. Explore what unique human capabilities matter in cybersecurity and what unique AI capabilities prove most valuable. Ask which NICE Framework Work Roles interest students after completing this activity.\nCritical Thinking\nProbe deeper into the complexities of human-AI collaboration. Ask who bears responsibility when a human-AI team makes a mistake. Discuss how professionals build trust in their AI partners while maintaining accountability. Explore the ethical considerations that arise when humans and AI share decision-making responsibilities. Ask whether AI ever suggested something that seemed wrong or incomplete, and how students handled that situation. Consider what would happen if organizations relied only on AI without human review.\nReal-World Application\nConnect the activity to authentic professional practice. Ask how real SOC analysts decide when to trust an AI alert versus investigate further. Discuss when it might be appropriate to override an AI recommendation and when one should trust it. Explore what skills students need to develop to become effective human partners to AI systems.\n\n\n\nAssessment Rubric\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCriteria\nEmerging (1)\nDeveloping (2)\nProficient (3)\nAdvanced (4)\n\n\n\n\nCollaboration Understanding\nViews AI as tool only\nRecognizes AI as assistant\nDemonstrates true partnership\nArticulates complementary strengths\n\n\nInvestigation Quality\nSurface-level analysis\nIdentifies basic patterns\nSystematic investigation\nComprehensive multi-layered analysis\n\n\nNICE Framework Application\nNo connection to Work Roles\nBasic role awareness\nClear role connections\nExplores career pathways\n\n\nEvidence Synthesis\nLists findings separately\nSome integration attempted\nWell-integrated conclusions\nNovel insights from synthesis\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssessment Connection\nThis table shows how activity elements connect to assessment rubric criteria:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRubric Criterion\nDeveloped Through\nEvidence Source\n\n\n\n\nAI Partnership Framing\nPart 2: “Frame AI as team member, not search engine”\nWorksheet: How student opened conversation with AI\n\n\nComplementary Strengths\nPart 2: “What AI Can and Can’t Do” callout\nWorksheet Part 2: Recording AI insights vs. limitations\n\n\nAI Limitation Awareness\nPart 2B: Mutual Accountability Check\nVerification checklist completion\n\n\nSynthesis Quality\nPart 3: Team Synthesis table\n“Key Insight” statement combining human + AI contributions\n\n\nDecision Justification\nPart 2B: “What if AI is wrong?”\nWritten response on accountability checklist\n\n\nNICE Framework Application\nDebrief: Work Role Connections\nVerbal responses to career pathway questions\n\n\n\nApplicable Rubrics: Human-AI Collaboration Rubric, Decision-Making Quality Rubric",

What do you think is fair?”\n\nExample AI responses to discuss:\nOn blocking websites: &gt; “I’m good at recognizing known dangerous sites quickly—much faster than a human could check. But I make mistakes with new sites or sites that look suspicious but are actually fine. I once blocked a science website because it had ‘chemical’ in the name! I think I should be able to block the really dangerous stuff fast, but someone should check my work on the uncertain ones.”\nOn watching students: &gt; “I can spot patterns humans might miss—like if someone is being cyberbullied or looking at worrying content. But I can’t understand context. A student researching ‘depression’ might be doing a health assignment, supporting a friend, or experiencing personal struggles. I honestly can’t tell the difference. A human needs to make that judgment.”\nOn learning: &gt; “Learning makes me better at my job. But I understand why that feels uncomfortable—it means I’m remembering what you do.

I need humans to check my uncertain decisions.”\n\n\nSchoolGuard says about watching: “I see patterns, not meanings. I might notice a student looking at sad things online, but I can’t know if they’re sad, researching for class, or helping a friend. Only a human can understand the difference and know what to do.”\n\n\nSchoolGuard says about learning: “Learning from data makes me smarter, but you should decide how much I remember. Some schools have me forget everything each week. Others let me remember longer. There’s no perfect answer—you have to decide what feels right for your school.”",

After 90 days, my false positive rate drops by 40%. I can recognize that a computer science student accessing security research sites is normal, while the same access from an administrative assistant is concerning.\nHowever, learning requires building models of individual behavior. I cannot learn ‘in general’—I learn about specific people. If you’re uncomfortable with me building behavioral profiles of students, I can operate in ‘stateless’ mode. I’ll be less accurate, but I won’t know anything about individual students beyond the current session.\nThis is a values question, not a technical one. Both approaches work. You must decide which aligns with your community’s values.”\n\n\n\nPolicy Template\nData Retention: - Routine activity logs: _______ (duration) - Security alerts: _______ (duration) - Behavioral models: _______ (duration) - Incident investigation data: _______ (duration)\nStudent data access rights: - Can students see what data exists about them? _______ - Can students request data deletion? _______ - How are students notified of monitoring? _______\nYour committee’s recommendation: _______________",

    "section": "Key Teaching Points",
    "text": "Key Teaching Points\n\nWhat We Learn from AI Mistakes\nThe central insight students should develop concerns the normative status of AI errors: every AI system produces mistakes, high confidence scores do not guarantee certainty, and pattern detection divorced from contextual understanding operates within inherent limitations.\nStudents should recognize that human oversight constitutes an intentional design feature rather than a contingency measure. AI systems are architected to flag potential concerns, not to render final decisions; human review represents a deliberate capability, not an emergency workaround; and override functionality exists by design to preserve human agency in consequential decisions.\nThe irreplaceable value of human contextual understanding emerges clearly from these scenarios. AI systems perceive patterns in data streams, while humans comprehend the meaning and significance underlying those patterns. Effective partnership requires both capabilities operating in complementary fashion.\nFinally, students should understand that disagreeing with AI recommendations represents professional judgment rather than defiance. Security professionals routinely override automated recommendations in their daily practice. Thorough documentation transforms individual overrides into organizational learning opportunities, and systematic feedback mechanisms enable continuous improvement of AI system performance.",

    "section": "Implementation Notes",
    "text": "Implementation Notes\n\nFacilitating the “AI Was Wrong” Conversation\nStudents may initially experience discomfort when asked to disagree with AI-generated recommendations. Instructors can normalize this critical stance by emphasizing that professional security analysts override automated recommendations as a routine component of their practice, by framing override decisions as collaborative refinement rather than adversarial confrontation, and by explicitly recognizing thoughtful disagreement as evidence of sophisticated analytical thinking.\n\n\nCreating Your Own Scenarios\nEffective scenarios for this activity share four defining characteristics. The AI must be technically correct in that the detected pattern genuinely exists in the data. Contextual knowledge must fundamentally alter the appropriate response, with human understanding revealing dimensions invisible to algorithmic analysis. The stakes must be operationally meaningful such that following the AI recommendation would produce consequential negative outcomes. Finally, no malicious actor need be involved; these situations arise organically from normal institutional operations.\n\n\nMaking It Memorable\nConsider establishing “AI Failure Friday” as a recurring classroom activity in which students identify, share, and collectively analyze scenarios where AI recommendations would require human override. This ongoing practice reinforces critical evaluation as habitual professional behavior rather than occasional intervention.",

Live AI interaction, multiple AI consultations, and individual AI access enhance the experience but are not essential to the core learning outcomes.\n\n\nLow-Resource Can Be High-Quality\nLow-resource approaches offer distinct advantages. They create more time for human discussion, encourage deeper analysis by preventing surface-level AI queries, develop better documentation practices, strengthen peer collaboration, and allow teachers to model excellent AI interaction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteLearn More: Equity in AI Education\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch on AI in education emphasizes that learning outcomes depend more on pedagogical framing than technology access. Students who deeply understand human-AI partnership dynamics through well-designed low-resource activities often outperform those with constant AI access but shallow engagement.
