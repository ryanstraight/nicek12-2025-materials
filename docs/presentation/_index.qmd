      Thank you for joining us for "True Teamwork!" I'm **Dr. Ryan Straight** from the **University of Arizona's College of Information Science**, where I teach cyber law, ethics, and policy.

      Today we're going to show you practical activities for teaching students to work WITH AI as teammates in cybersecurity—not competing with it, not just using it as a tool, but genuinely collaborating.

      We have **35 minutes together**. I'll keep the background brief—just 2-3 minutes—then we'll dive into **two activities** you can try right here, right now. Let's go!

[THE REALITY]{.r-fit-text}

## The Pedagogical Gap

::: {.fragment}
**You know the SOC reality.** Your students don't—yet.

The challenge isn't explaining *that* humans and AI collaborate.

It's designing experiences where students **discover it themselves**.
:::

::: {.fragment}
**The shift we're engineering:**

[Humans **using** tools → Humans **and** AI as **teammates**]{.r-fit-text}
:::

::: {.notes}
You already know what modern SOC work looks like—that's why you're here.

The pedagogical challenge is different: How do we create classroom experiences where students DISCOVER the value of human-AI partnership rather than just hearing us explain it?

→ PAUSE

These activities are designed to engineer that discovery. Students experience firsthand what each partner contributes—and they remember it because they found it themselves.

Let's look at how this works in practice.
:::

## {#the-challenge data-menu-title="The Design Problem"}

::: {.r-fit-text}
**The Design Problem**
:::

::: {.fragment}
**Three things students need to discover:**

1. What AI genuinely contributes (not magic, not nothing)
2. What humans uniquely contribute (not just "oversight")
3. How the partnership produces better outcomes than either alone

**These activities scaffold that discovery.**
:::

::: {.notes}
So here's the design problem we solved.

Students need to discover three things—and "discover" is the key word. Telling them doesn't work.

First: what AI actually contributes. Not magic, not useless—genuinely useful for specific things.

Second: what humans uniquely bring. And it's more than just "oversight" or "final approval."

Third—and this is the insight that sticks—how the partnership produces outcomes neither could achieve alone.

→ PAUSE

The activities we'll show you are specifically designed to scaffold these discoveries. Let's see how they work.
:::

# {#activity-1 data-menu-title="Activity 1" background-color="#AB0520" background-image="media/banner_reverse.png" background-size="40%" background-position="right 5% top 5%"}

[ACTIVITY 1]{.r-fit-text}

## Security Detective Teams {background-color="#0C234B"}

**12 minutes** | Grades 6-8 (adaptable K-12)

::: {.fragment}
**The design:** Students investigate a security incident WITH an AI partner

**The discovery moment:** When students realize AI spotted something they missed—AND they spotted something AI missed—the partnership insight lands.
:::

::: {.notes}
Activity 1: Security Detective Teams.

The design is straightforward: students investigate a security incident with an AI partner.

But the pedagogical key is engineering the discovery moment. We structure the evidence so AI will catch certain patterns students miss—AND students will notice contextual clues AI can't interpret.

When both happen, you don't have to explain the value of partnership. They've experienced it.

Let's talk implementation options first—because I know not everyone has AI access for every student.
:::

## Implementation Options {.smaller}

**Designed for your actual constraints:**

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Teacher as AI Voice** ⭐ *Often strongest*

You voice AI responses—control pacing, surface limitations intentionally

**Pre-Generated Cards**

Print response cards—same discovery, no tech dependency
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Rotation Stations**

One device, groups rotate (5-min turns)

**Think-Aloud Demo**

Project one conversation, whole class analyzes
:::
::::

::: {.notes}
Four implementation options—each designed around real classroom constraints.

Teacher as AI Voice is often pedagogically strongest. You control pacing, you can intentionally surface AI limitations at the right moments, and students focus on analysis rather than interface navigation.

Pre-generated response cards work identically to live AI for the learning objectives. Same discovery, no technology dependency.

Rotation stations if you have limited devices. Think-aloud demo for whole-class modeling.

The technical guides detail each option. They're not workarounds—they're intentional design choices.

Now let me show you the live AI version for those who have access...
:::

## Let's Try It Together!

*If you DO have live AI access, here's what it looks like:*

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
::: {.glass-card}
**Incident:** User "jmiller" account compromised

**Evidence:**

- Password: `Summer2024!`
- Phishing emails in inbox
- AI says "medium strength"
- Logins during work hours
:::
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
::: {.fragment}
### Your task:

**What REALLY happened here?**

*(30 seconds—think or discuss with a neighbor)*
:::
:::
::::

::: {.notes}
Now let me show you what this looks like when you DO have live AI access. Same activity, same learning objectives—just with students interacting directly.

Here's a scenario we can try together right now.

User account was compromised. The password was "Summer2024!" and an automated checker rates it "medium strength."

But there's more: phishing emails were found in the user's inbox. And the suspicious logins happened during normal work hours.

→ PAUSE

Take 30 seconds—what do you think really happened here?

[Give them time to think/discuss with neighbors]
:::

## The Designed Discovery

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
**AI catches:**

- "Summer2024!" = predictable pattern
- Seasonal + year structure
- Matches compromised password databases
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Students catch:**

- Phishing emails + compromise = connected
- Work hours timing matters
- Social engineering context
:::

::::

::: {.fragment}
**The insight:** Neither alone gets the full picture. Students experience this—they don't just hear it.
:::

::: {.notes}
Here's how the discovery is designed.

We structure the evidence so AI will identify the password pattern—and it does, reliably. Students see AI contribute something useful.

But the phishing connection? The timing context? AI doesn't flag those. Students do.

→ PAUSE

When they synthesize both contributions, they've experienced the partnership value firsthand. You don't explain it—they discovered it.

The scenario is structured so this discovery is reliable—it's not left to chance.
:::

## Built-In Verification Protocol {.smaller}

**Scaffolded into the activity:**

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.glass-card}
1. How would I verify this finding?
2. What other sources should I check?
3. What's the cost if AI is wrong here?
:::
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.fragment}
**Why we built this in:**

Students naturally over-trust or under-trust AI. The verification step calibrates appropriate skepticism—without dismissiveness.
:::
:::
::::

::: {.notes}
We built a verification protocol directly into the activity flow.

Here's why: At the college level, we consistently see students swing between two extremes—either treating AI as infallible or dismissing it entirely. This protocol addresses that pattern.

The verification checkpoint calibrates appropriate skepticism. Students learn to trust AI outputs AND verify them. That's the professional standard you're preparing them for.

The questions are scaffolded: What would verification look like? What sources? And crucially—what's the cost of being wrong? That last question grounds the abstract in consequences.
:::

## In Your Classroom {.smaller}

**Activity flow (35 min):**

1. **Evidence** (5 min) — Present scenario
2. **AI partner** (10 min) — Pattern analysis
3. **Human context** (10 min) — What AI misses
4. **Synthesis** (10 min) — Combine insights
:::

::: {.column width="45%"}

**The download includes:**

- Full lesson plan
- Evidence packets (print-ready)
- AI prompts for students
- **All grade bands: K-2, 3-5, 6-8, 9-12**
:::
:::
::::

::: {.notes}
Here's how it runs in your classroom—full lesson is in the download.

Present the evidence—5 minutes to set the scene.

Students partner with AI—actually consult ChatGPT, Claude, whatever you have access to—for about 10 minutes.

Then the crucial step: What does AI miss? Why does human context matter? Another 10 minutes.

Finally, they synthesize and present their findings.

→ PAUSE

The download includes everything: the full lesson plan, evidence packets you can print, sample AI prompts for students to use.

AND—this is new—we created grade-band versions for ALL age groups. K-2, 3-5, 6-8, and 9-12. So you can use this same core activity with elementary students all the way up to high schoolers.
:::

# {#activity-2 data-menu-title="Activity 2" background-color="#0C234B" background-image="media/banner_reverse.png" background-size="40%" background-position="right 5% top 5%"}

[ACTIVITY 2]{.r-fit-text}

## Ethics in Automated Security {background-color="#0C234B"}

**12 minutes** | Grades 6-8 (adaptable K-12)

::: {.fragment}
**The design:** Students design governance policies for AI security systems

**The discovery moment:** When they hear AI articulate its own limitations, policy design becomes collaborative—not just restrictive.
:::

::: {.notes}
Activity 2: Ethics in Automated Security.

This one shifts perspective. Students aren't using AI—they're designing the rules AI operates under.

The pedagogical key is a specific design choice: we have the AI articulate its own capabilities AND limitations. When students hear AI say "I can spot this pattern, but I can't understand this context," their policy-making shifts from restriction to collaboration.

They stop asking "how do we control AI?" and start asking "how do we design policies that leverage what AI does well while protecting against what it can't do?"

Let's see how this works.
:::

## The Setup

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="65%"}
::: {.glass-card}
**Scenario:** Your school is getting "SchoolGuard"

**It can:**

- See what websites students visit
- Block "dangerous" sites
- Alert teachers about "unusual" activity
- Learn from student behavior patterns
:::
:::

::: {.column width="35%"}
::: {.fragment}
### Your job:

Decide what SchoolGuard should do **automatically** vs. **ask humans first**
:::
:::
::::

::: {.notes}
Here's the scenario: Your school is implementing an AI security system called SchoolGuard.

It can monitor website visits, block dangerous sites, alert teachers about unusual activity, and learn from patterns.

→ PAUSE

Your job—and the students' job—is to decide: What should SchoolGuard do automatically? What should require human approval first?

Let's vote on some real policy questions.
:::

## Quick Vote: Policy Decision 1

::: {.r-fit-text}
**Should SchoolGuard automatically block sites it thinks are malicious?**
:::

::: {.fragment}
**Option A:** Yes, block automatically (faster protection)

**Option B:** No, require human approval (fewer mistakes)

**Option C:** Auto-block known threats, ask about uncertain ones
:::

::: {.notes}
First policy question: Should SchoolGuard automatically block malicious sites?

[Read options]

Vote with your hands—raise for A... B... C...

[Count/observe distribution]

Interesting! Here's the thing—there's no wrong answer. Each choice involves real trade-offs.

Automatic blocking is faster—but it might block legitimate sites by mistake.

Human approval prevents errors—but creates dangerous delays.

Option C sounds reasonable—but who decides what's "known" versus "uncertain"?

This is exactly what your students will discover.
:::

## Quick Vote: Policy Decision 2

::: {.r-fit-text}
**Should SchoolGuard alert teachers about "unusual" student activity?**
:::

::: {.fragment}
**Option A:** Yes, alert immediately (safety first)

**Option B:** No, too much surveillance

**Option C:** Only alert for serious safety concerns
:::

::: {.notes}
Second question: Should SchoolGuard alert teachers about unusual student activity?

[Read options]

Vote—A... B... C...

[Observe]

This one gets heated in classrooms! Students have strong feelings about surveillance.

But here's what's powerful: when students hear the AI's perspective, their thinking evolves.
:::

## What Does the AI Say? {.smaller}

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.glass-card}
**What I CAN do:**

"I spot patterns humans miss. I've identified students at risk of self-harm weeks before any visible signs."
:::
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.fragment .glass-card}
**What I CAN'T do:**

"I flagged a student researching gun violence for a **history paper**. I see patterns, not intentions."
:::
:::
::::

::: {.notes}
This is the designed pivot point.

We script AI to articulate both capabilities and limitations in first person. Students hear AI claim credit for genuine value AND acknowledge genuine blind spots.

The pedagogical effect: policy design shifts from adversarial ("how do we restrict AI?") to collaborative ("how do we structure human-AI handoffs?").

That reframing—from control to collaboration—is exactly what we want students to carry into careers.
:::

## In Your Classroom {.smaller}

**Activity flow (40 min):**

1. **Scenario** (5 min) — Intro SchoolGuard
2. **Policy design** (15 min) — 3 decisions
3. **AI perspective** (5 min) — Capabilities & limits
4. **Debate** (10 min) — Defend choices
5. **Reflection** (5 min) — What's hard?

**Grade-band versions:**

- **K-2:** "Robot Helper Rules"
- **3-5:** "Computer Rules Committee"
- **9-12:** "AI Governance Workshop"

*All include scenario cards + AI voice scripts*
:::
:::
::::

::: {.notes}
In your classroom, here's the flow—full details in the download.

Set up the scenario, introduce the AI system. Small groups design policies for 3 questions. Then—and this is crucial—the AI shares its perspective, including its limitations.

Class debate: different groups present and defend their choices. Finally, reflection: what's genuinely hard about these decisions?

→ PAUSE

We created grade-band versions:

For K-2, it's "Robot Helper Rules"—students decide what classroom-robot Sparky can do by itself versus ask first.

For 3-5, "Computer Rules Committee"—designing school technology policies.

For 9-12, it gets sophisticated: "AI Governance Workshop" with actual legal frameworks like FERPA, stakeholder role-play, real policy documentation.

Same core idea, adapted to developmental level.

**AI-Assisted Incident Response** is in your download!

- NICE Framework Work Roles
- Realistic incidents (ransomware, breaches)
- AI recommends, humans decide
- Connects to cybersecurity careers

::::

::: {.notes}
You might notice we promised three activities. The third one—AI-Assisted Incident Response—is complete in your download.

In that activity, students experience actual NICE Framework work roles. They respond to realistic incidents like ransomware attacks and data breaches. The AI recommends actions, but humans make the final decisions.

It's great for connecting cybersecurity education to career pathways.

→ PAUSE

We chose to go deep on two activities today so you could really experience them, rather than rushing through three.

All three are complete in your materials—same quality, same facilitation guides, same grade-band versions. K-2 through 9-12 for everything.

The career connection handouts translate activity tasks into language students—and administrators—can connect to workforce outcomes.
:::

## Implementation Considerations

::: {.r-fit-text}
**As you plan adaptation...**
:::

- What's your current AI access reality? (Low-resource options are robust)
- Which discovery moments matter most for your students?
- How do these connect to existing curriculum?
- What adaptations are you already considering?

::: {.notes}
A few implementation considerations as you plan:

AI access: The low-resource options aren't compromises—they're often pedagogically stronger because they force focus on the thinking rather than the technology.

Discovery moments: Different contexts may emphasize different insights. The materials are modular enough to prioritize what matters for your students.

Curriculum connections: Where do these fit in what you're already doing? They're designed as standalone activities but also as entry points.

What adaptations are you already thinking about? Let's discuss.
