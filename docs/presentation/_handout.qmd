## Session Overview

Preparing K-12 students for cybersecurity careers where **human-AI collaboration is the norm, not the exception**. Three classroom-ready activities demonstrate how AI serves as **team member**, not just tool.

## Download All Materials

**[ryanstraight.github.io/nicek12-2025-materials](https://ryanstraight.github.io/nicek12-2025-materials)**

**You get:**

- **12 lesson plans** (3 activities × 4 grade bands)
- Assessment rubrics (collaboration, decision-making, NICE Framework)
- Technical setup guides (including low-resource options)
- Student worksheets and pre-generated AI response cards
- Everything works with ANY level of AI access!

## The Three Activities

| Activity | Focus | What Students Do |
|----------|-------|------------------|
| **Security Detective Teams** | Investigation | Partner with AI to solve security mysteries |
| **AI-Assisted Incident Response** | Teamwork | Work in roles during realistic security incidents |
| **Ethics in Automated Security** | Policy Design | Decide what AI can do automatically vs. ask humans |

**All activities include K-2, 3-5, 6-8, and 9-12 versions!**

## Grade-Band Versions

| Grade Band | Security Detective | Incident Response | Ethics |
|------------|-------------------|-------------------|--------|
| **K-2** | "Mystery Helpers" | "Fix It Team!" | "Robot Helper Rules" |
| **3-5** | "Locked Library" | "Computer Problem Solvers" | "Computer Rules Committee" |
| **6-8** | Full investigation | Team response | SchoolGuard policies |
| **9-12** | SOC simulation | Enterprise incident | AI Governance Workshop |

## Implementation Options

| Resource Level | Approach |
|---------------|----------|
| **Full AI access** | Students partner directly with ChatGPT, Claude, etc. |
| **Limited access** | Rotation stations, shared accounts |
| **No AI access** | Pre-generated response cards, teacher as AI voice |

**All approaches teach the same core concepts!**

## Works For Your Context

| Context | How These Help |
|---------|----------------|
| **CTE Programs** | NICE Framework-aligned, mirrors real SOC workflows, career pathway ready |
| **Outreach Programs** | Turnkey delivery, scalable, assessment-ready for grant reporting |
| **STEAM/Interdisciplinary** | Cross-curricular connections built in (data analysis, ethics, communication) |

## The Key Insight

::: {.callout-tip}
## What makes this different?

**Not**: "Humans USE AI tools"
**Instead**: "Humans AND AI as teammates"

AI is great at patterns. Humans are great at context. **Together they're better than either alone.**
