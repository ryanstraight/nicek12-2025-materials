## Printing Tips

These suggestions will help you get the most out of your materials. Card stock makes a real difference for items students will handle repeatedly.

### Paper Recommendations

| Material Type | Paper Recommendation |
|---------------|---------------------|
| Quick-Start Guides | Standard copy paper |
| Student Worksheets | Standard copy paper (front/back) |
| Evidence Packets | Standard copy paper |
| Role Cards | Card stock for durability |
| AI Response Cards | Card stock for repeated use |
| Complication Cards | Card stock, consider laminating |

### Print Settings

- **Paper size:** Letter (8.5" × 11")
- **Color:** Black and white works well for all materials
- **Duplex:** Recommended for worksheets to reduce paper usage

### Quantities Guide

Here is a quick reference for a class of 30 students organized into 6 groups:

| Material | Quantity |
|----------|----------|
| Quick-Start Guide | 1 (teacher reference) |
| Student Worksheets | 30 (1 per student) |
| Evidence Packets / Incident Briefings | 6 (1 per group) |
| Role Cards | 6 sets (1 set per group) |
| AI Response Cards (low-resource) | 6 sets (1 per group) |
| Complication Cards | 1 set (teacher use) |
