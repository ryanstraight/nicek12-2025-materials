# Human-AI Partnership Activities for K-12 Cybersecurity Education

**From the NICE K12 Cybersecurity Education Conference 2025**

Three complete, classroom-ready activities, each with four grade-band versions spanning K-2 through 9-12, designed to reshape how students understand AI in cybersecurity.
:::

## The Core Idea

These activities guide students beyond viewing AI as merely a tool and toward understanding it as a **collaborative partner** in cybersecurity work.

| Old Thinking | New Thinking |
|--------------|--------------|
| Humans **use** AI tools | Humans **and** AI work as teammates |
| AI is either adversary or tool | AI serves as a collaborative partner |
| Individual competency matters | Partnership capability matters |

**Why this matters:** Contemporary cybersecurity depends on humans and AI working in concert. Students benefit from understanding what each partner contributes, as well as what neither can accomplish alone.

## Learn More: The Theory Behind "AI as Partner"

This framing draws from **posthuman educational theory**, which challenges us to see technology not as something we simply *use*, but as something we *work with*. Rosi Braidotti's foundational work and Catherine Adams' practical heuristics for "interviewing digital objects" inform how these activities position AI as a collaborative teammate with distinct capabilities and limitations.

## The Three Activities

| Activity | Focus | Grade Bands |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| **1. Security Detective Teams** | Combining AI pattern recognition with human contextual insight | K-2, 3-5, 6-8, 9-12 |
| **2. Ethics in Automated Security** | Developing governance frameworks for AI security systems | K-2, 3-5, 6-8, 9-12 |
| **3. AI-Assisted Incident Response** | Coordinating team roles alongside AI under time pressure | K-2, 3-5, 6-8, 9-12 |

Each activity comes with complete lesson plans, student materials, assessment rubrics, and strategies for classrooms with limited technology access.

## Framework Alignment

Every activity connects to NICE Workforce Framework Work Roles and CYBER.org K-12 Standards. Individual activity pages provide specific alignment details.

## For CTE Cybersecurity Programs

These activities align directly with Career and Technical Education pathways:

| CTE Need | How These Materials Help |
|----------|-------------------------|
| **Industry-aligned skills** | Activities mirror authentic SOC workflows and incident response procedures |
| **NICE Framework mapping** | Every activity explicitly connects to Work Roles (PR-CDA-001, PR-CIR-001, OV-SPP-002) |
| **Career exploration** | One-page career connection handouts link activities to real job pathways |
| **Employer expectations** | Human-AI collaboration is now standard in enterprise security operations |

The 9-12 versions provide technical depth appropriate for cybersecurity pathway courses, while 6-8 versions work well for exploratory CTE programs.

## For Outreach Programs

Research centers, universities, and community organizations can deploy these materials with K-12 partners:

- **Turnkey delivery** — Complete lesson plans require minimal customization
- **Scalable** — Works for single classroom visits or semester-long partnerships
- **Flexible technology requirements** — Low-resource options mean any partner school can participate
- **Assessment-ready** — Rubrics help document learning outcomes for grant reporting
- **Train-the-trainer friendly** — Materials are detailed enough for partner teachers to run independently

## STEAM Integration

These activities connect naturally across disciplines:

- **Science** — Pattern recognition, hypothesis testing, evidence analysis
- **Technology** — AI systems, cybersecurity tools, network concepts
- **Engineering** — Systems thinking, incident response procedures, policy design
- **Arts** — Communication design, stakeholder messaging, ethical reasoning
- **Mathematics** — Data analysis, probability (false positives), timeline reconstruction

The investigation and policy design activities work especially well in interdisciplinary or project-based learning contexts.

## Conference Session: What to Expect

::: {.callout-note}
## Session Format (45 Minutes)

Attendees will **experience one activity as learners**, then receive access to the complete K-12 curriculum repository with dedicated implementation planning time.

| Phase | Time | What Happens |
|-------|------|--------------|
| **Experience** | 20 min | Participate in one complete activity (Middle School Phishing Response Team) |
| **Materials Tour** | 10 min | Overview of curriculum ecosystem and implementation guide walkthrough |
| **Planning** | 10 min | Select grade-appropriate activities and begin implementation planning |
| **Resources** | 5 min | Access repository, follow-up support information, Q&A |

**What you take home**: Complete access to all 12 lesson plans, assessment rubrics, printable materials, and implementation guides—ready for immediate classroom use.

## Limited Technology Access? No Problem.

These activities function effectively at any level of AI access, including none at all. The [Low-Resource Implementation Guide](guides/low-resource-implementation.qmd) offers strategies that frequently produce richer learning experiences than live AI access.
