# Human-AI Partnership Activities for K-12 Cybersecurity Education

**From the NICE K12 Cybersecurity Education Conference 2025**

Three complete, classroom-ready activities, each with four grade-band versions spanning K-2 through 9-12, designed to reshape how students understand AI in cybersecurity.
:::

## The Core Idea

These activities guide students beyond viewing AI as merely a tool and toward understanding it as a **collaborative partner** in cybersecurity work.

| Old Thinking | New Thinking |
|--------------|--------------|
| Humans **use** AI tools | Humans **and** AI work as teammates |
| AI is either adversary or tool | AI serves as a collaborative partner |
| Individual competency matters | Partnership capability matters |

Cybersecurity depends on humans and AI working in concert. Students benefit from understanding what each partner contributes, as well as what neither can accomplish alone.

## Learn More: The Theory Behind "AI as Partner"

This framing draws from **posthuman educational theory**, which challenges us to see technology not as something we simply *use*, but as something we *work with*. Rosi Braidotti's foundational work and Catherine Adams' practical heuristics for "interviewing digital objects" inform how these activities position AI as a collaborative teammate with distinct capabilities and limitations.

## The Three Activities

For the NICE K12 Cybersecurity Education Conference, we developed three concrete activities to demonstrate this approach. Each includes variations for different gradebands. Each activity comes with complete lesson plans, student materials, assessment rubrics, and strategies for classrooms with limited technology access.

| Activity | Focus | Grade Bands |
|:----------|:-------|:-------------|
| **[1. Security Detective Teams](activities/01-security-detective-teams/)** | Combining AI pattern recognition with human contextual insight | [K-2](activities/01-security-detective-teams/k2.qmd), [3-5](activities/01-security-detective-teams/grades-3-5.qmd), [6-8](activities/01-security-detective-teams/grades-6-8.qmd), [9-12](activities/01-security-detective-teams/grades-9-12.qmd) |
| **[2. Ethics in Automated Security](activities/02-ethics-automated-security/)** | Developing governance frameworks for AI security systems | [K-2](activities/02-ethics-automated-security/k2.qmd), [3-5](activities/02-ethics-automated-security/grades-3-5.qmd), [6-8](activities/02-ethics-automated-security/grades-6-8.qmd), [9-12](activities/02-ethics-automated-security/grades-9-12.qmd) |
| **[3. AI-Assisted Incident Response](activities/03-ai-incident-response/)** | Coordinating team roles alongside AI under time pressure | [K-2](activities/03-ai-incident-response/k2.qmd), [3-5](activities/03-ai-incident-response/grades-3-5.qmd), [6-8](activities/03-ai-incident-response/grades-6-8.qmd), [9-12](activities/03-ai-incident-response/grades-9-12.qmd) |

## Framework Alignment

Every activity connects to [NICE Workforce Framework](https://niccs.cisa.gov/workforce-development/nice-framework) Work Roles and [CYBER.org K-12 Standards](https://cyber.org/curriculum/standards). Individual activity pages provide specific alignment details.

::: {.audience-card}
### For CTE Cybersecurity Programs

These activities align directly with Career and Technical Education pathways:

| CTE Need | How These Materials Help |
|----------|-------------------------|
| **Industry-aligned skills** | Activities mirror authentic SOC workflows and incident response procedures |
| **NICE Framework mapping** | Every activity explicitly connects to Work Roles (Defensive Cybersecurity, Incident Response, Cybersecurity Policy and Planning) |
| **Career exploration** | [One-page career connection handouts](career-connections/) link activities to real job pathways |
| **Employer expectations** | Human-AI collaboration is now standard in enterprise security operations |

The [9-12 versions](activities/01-security-detective-teams/grades-9-12.qmd) provide technical depth appropriate for cybersecurity pathway courses, while [6-8 versions](activities/01-security-detective-teams/grades-6-8.qmd) work well for exploratory CTE programs.

### For Outreach Programs

Research centers, universities, and community organizations can deploy these materials with K-12 partners:

- **Turnkey delivery** — Complete lesson plans require minimal customization
- **Scalable** — Works for single classroom visits or semester-long partnerships
- **Flexible technology requirements** — [Low-resource options](guides/low-resource-implementation.qmd) mean any partner school can participate
- **Assessment-ready** — [Rubrics](assessments/) help document learning outcomes for grant reporting
- **Train-the-trainer friendly** — Materials are detailed enough for partner teachers to run independently
:::

::: {.audience-card}
### STEAM Integration

These activities connect naturally across disciplines:

- **Science** — Pattern recognition, hypothesis testing, evidence analysis
- **Technology** — AI systems, cybersecurity tools, network concepts
- **Engineering** — Systems thinking, incident response procedures, policy design
- **Arts** — Communication design, stakeholder messaging, ethical reasoning
- **Mathematics** — Data analysis, probability (false positives), timeline reconstruction

The investigation and policy design activities work especially well in interdisciplinary or project-based learning contexts.

## Limited Technology Access? No Problem.

These activities function effectively at any level of AI access, including none at all. The [Low-Resource Implementation Guide](guides/low-resource-implementation.qmd) offers strategies that frequently produce richer learning experiences than live AI access.
