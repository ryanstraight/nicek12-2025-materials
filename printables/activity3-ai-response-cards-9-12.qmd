## How to Use These Cards

For classrooms without AI access, use these pre-written AI responses. The teacher can read them aloud, or teams can draw cards at appropriate moments in the activity.

**Important:** These cards preserve the learning experience—students still hear AI perspectives and must interpret them critically.

## Grades 9-12: SentinelAI Analysis Reports

### Initial Triage Report

::: {.ai-card}
## SentinelAI Analysis Report #7291-A

**Classification:** CRITICAL
**Confidence:** 94%

---

**Pattern Analysis:**

Lateral movement pattern indicates credential-based attack. Service account `svc_backup` shows authentication anomaly:

- Normal operation: 02:00-03:00 AM
- Current activity: 06:58-07:12 AM
- Statistical deviation: 99.7th percentile

**Attack Chain Mapping (MITRE ATT&CK):**

```
Initial Access (T1566.001) → Execution (T1204.002) →
Persistence (T1547.001) → Credential Access (T1078.002) →
Lateral Movement (T1021.002) → Collection (T1074.001) →
Command and Control (T1071.001)
```

**Risk Assessment:**

- 94% probability: Active compromise in progress
- Estimated impact if delayed 2 hours: 800GB additional data staging
- Potential OT system access via HVAC-CONTROLLER-01

---

**⚠️ LIMITATION NOTICE:**

This analysis does not account for:

- Manufacturing production schedules
- Employee shift patterns
- Business-critical deadlines
- Stakeholder communication requirements
- Reputational impact assessment

**Human decision authority required for all containment actions.**

### Threat Intelligence Correlation

::: {.ai-card}
## SentinelAI Threat Intelligence Report

**Query:** Threat actor correlation for indicators

---

**Attribution Assessment:**

Indicators correlate with APT29/Cozy Bear with moderate-high confidence (78%).

**Campaign Match:**

MANUFACTURING-AUTUMN campaign targeting industrial sector (first observed September 2024).

**Typical Objectives:**

- Industrial espionage
- Supply chain intelligence
- Intellectual property theft
- Long-term persistent access

**Expected TTPs:**

1. Spearphishing with macro-enabled documents
2. Service account credential abuse
3. Data staging before exfiltration
4. Low-and-slow data transfer via encrypted channels

**Prediction:**

If this matches APT29 pattern, data exfiltration likely planned for nighttime hours when monitoring is reduced.

---

**⚠️ LIMITATION NOTICE:**

Attribution is probabilistic. Sophisticated actors can false-flag. Business decisions should not rely solely on attribution confidence.

### Response Recommendation

::: {.ai-card}
## SentinelAI Response Recommendation

**Recommended Actions (ranked by urgency):**

1. **IMMEDIATE:** Authorize endpoint isolation for affected workstations
   - Impact: Manufacturing floor disruption
   - Risk if delayed: Additional lateral movement

2. **IMMEDIATE:** Reset service account credentials
   - Impact: Brief service interruption
   - Risk if delayed: Continued unauthorized access

3. **PRIORITY:** Network segmentation for OT systems
   - Impact: IT overhead increase
   - Risk if delayed: Potential OT compromise

4. **STANDARD:** Executive notification
   - Impact: Low
   - Risk if delayed: Trust erosion

---

**⚠️ WHAT I CANNOT ASSESS:**

- Whether production deadlines justify delayed containment
- Impact on employee morale from sudden shutdowns
- Political dynamics between IT and operations leadership
- Legal implications of various response options
- Whether partial measures might be sufficient

**I optimize for security metrics. You must optimize for organizational outcomes.**

## Grades 6-8: School Incident AI Responses

### On Ransomware Discovery

::: {.ai-card}
## AI Security Advisor Response

**Your Question:** What are we dealing with?

---

**Analysis:**

The symptoms you describe—encrypted files with ransom notes—indicate ransomware infection. Based on the evidence:

- **Entry point:** Likely the suspicious email opened Friday
- **Spread timing:** Weekend allowed time for encryption
- **Scope:** 30% of systems suggests partial containment possible

**My Recommendations:**

1. **Immediate:** Isolate affected systems from network
2. **Priority:** Check if backups are intact and unaffected
3. **Consider:** Whether Thursday's backup covers critical data
4. **Prepare:** Communications for staff, students, parents

---

**What I can't tell you:**

- Whether paying the ransom would actually work
- How students and parents will react to data loss
- Whether the backup has everything teachers need
- How long recovery will actually take

**These are human judgment calls.**

### On Grade Database Breach

::: {.ai-card}
## AI Security Advisor Response

**Your Question:** How bad is this?

---

**Analysis:**

This appears to be an insider threat or compromised credentials scenario. Key indicators:

- Unauthorized admin account creation suggests privilege escalation
- Pattern of grade changes (F→passing) indicates specific motivation
- Multiple IP addresses could mean shared credentials or VPN use

**My Recommendations:**

1. **Immediate:** Disable the unauthorized account
2. **Priority:** Audit all grade changes in affected timeframe
3. **Consider:** Whether student records were accessed beyond grades
4. **Prepare:** Notification plan for affected students/parents

---

**What I can't tell you:**

- Whether this was a student, staff member, or external actor
- Whether the original grades can be trusted
- How to handle the academic integrity questions
- What disciplinary actions are appropriate

**Security and academic integrity are both your concerns—I can only address the first.**

### On Social Media Compromise

::: {.ai-card}
## AI Security Advisor Response

**Your Question:** What should we do about the hacked accounts?

---

**Analysis:**

This is a coordinated account takeover. Foreign IPs and ignored password resets suggest:

- Attackers likely had access for days before acting
- Multiple platforms indicate credential reuse or password spraying
- Staff data exposure creates identity theft risk
- Viral spread means reputational damage is already occurring

**My Recommendations:**

1. **Immediate:** Contact platforms to report compromise and request takedown
2. **Priority:** Secure all other school accounts with password resets
3. **Consider:** Whether to make public statement before or after recovery
4. **Prepare:** Identity protection information for affected staff

---

**What I can't tell you:**

- Whether deleting accounts or recovering them is the right call
- How to handle media inquiries appropriately
- What legal obligations you have for the data breach
- How to rebuild trust with the community

**Communication strategy is a human decision. I can help with technical recovery.**

## Grades 3-5: Computer Problem AI Responses

### About the Pop-ups

::: {.ai-card}
## AI Helper Response

**Your Question:** What are these pop-ups?

---

Pop-up messages claiming you won a prize are almost always fake, especially if they have spelling mistakes. Real contests don't work this way!

These are usually caused by **malware**—programs that got on your computer without permission.

**How it probably happened:**

Someone clicked a link in a tricky email. The email looked real, but it wasn't!

**Important clue:**

The spelling mistakes ("Congradulations!") tell us this is fake. Real companies check their spelling!
:::

---

### About How It Spreads

::: {.ai-card}
## AI Helper Response

**Your Question:** How did the bad program get on the computers?

---

Bad programs usually get on computers when someone:

- **Clicks links** in emails that look real but aren't
- **Downloads** games or apps from unsafe websites
- **Opens attachments** from people they don't know

Once on one computer, the bad program can sometimes spread to others on the same network—like catching a cold!

**Why only Mrs. Chen's class?**

Someone in that class probably clicked something on Friday. The other classrooms didn't click it, so they're okay!

### About Fixing It

::: {.ai-card}
## AI Helper Response

**Your Question:** How do we fix this?

---

This isn't something students should try to fix themselves! Here's why:

The school's **IT team** has special tools to:

- Remove bad programs safely
- Check if the bad program spread
- Make sure it doesn't come back

**What students should do:**

1. **Tell an adult** right away
2. **Don't click** on any pop-ups
3. **Remember** this experience so you can avoid tricky emails in the future

**The most important fix:** Learn from this so it doesn't happen again!

## Grades K-2: Robot Helper Responses

### What Sparky Found

::: {.ai-card}
## 🤖 Sparky the Robot Helper Says:

"Beep boop! I checked some things!

✓ The computers are plugged in
✓ The power strips have lights
✗ Wait! The main switch is OFF!

I found the problem! But I'm not allowed to flip the switch without a person saying it's okay."
:::

---

### Why Sparky Needs Permission

::: {.ai-card}
## 🤖 Sparky Explains:

"Even though I found the problem, I need a person to decide if it's safe to fix it.

What if someone's stuff was in the way?
What if there was a reason it was turned off?
What if I make a mistake?

That's why people and robot helpers work together!"
