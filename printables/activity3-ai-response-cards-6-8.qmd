These cards provide AI Security Advisor responses for the incident response simulation. Teams can draw cards at decision points, or the teacher can distribute them as the scenario progresses.

## For Teachers

**How to use:**

- Match cards to the incident your team is investigating
- Each card provides AI analysis AND explicit limitations
- Teams should document how AI insights shaped their decisions

**The goal:** Students experience AI as an analytical partner with genuine limitations requiring human judgment.

## Scenario A: Ransomware Discovery

### Card A1: Initial Assessment

*Use when the team first investigates the ransomware incident*

> **🔒 AI Security Advisor says:**
>
> "I've analyzed the symptoms you described. Here's my assessment:
>
> **INCIDENT TYPE:** Ransomware infection
>
> **WHAT I SEE:**
> - Encrypted files with ransom notes = confirmed ransomware
> - Friday email → Weekend encryption = typical timing pattern
> - 30% of systems affected = partial spread, containment possible
>
> **ATTACK TIMELINE (reconstructed):**
> ```
> Friday PM: Suspicious email opened
> Friday-Sunday: Malware spreading and encrypting
> Monday AM: Staff discovers encrypted files
> ```
>
> **MY RECOMMENDATIONS:**
> 1. **IMMEDIATE:** Isolate affected systems from network
> 2. **PRIORITY:** Check if Thursday backup is intact
> 3. **CONSIDER:** Whether backup covers critical data
> 4. **PREPARE:** Communications for staff, students, parents
>
> **WHAT I CANNOT ASSESS:**
> - Whether paying ransom would actually work (often it doesn't)
> - How students and parents will react to potential data loss
> - Whether the backup has everything teachers actually need
> - How long recovery will realistically take given your IT resources
> - Who needs to know first and how to tell them
>
> **These are human judgment calls. I provide technical analysis; you provide organizational wisdom.**"

## Scenario B: Grade Database Breach

### Card B1: Breach Analysis

*Use when the team investigates the grade database incident*

> **🔒 AI Security Advisor says:**
>
> "I've analyzed the database activity logs. Here's what I found:
>
> **INCIDENT TYPE:** Unauthorized access with data modification
>
> **KEY INDICATORS:**
> - Unauthorized admin account created = privilege escalation
> - Pattern of grade changes (F → passing) = targeted modifications
> - Multiple IP addresses = possible shared credentials or VPN use
>
> **WHAT THE EVIDENCE SUGGESTS:**
> This is either an insider threat (someone at the school) or compromised credentials being used by an outside actor.
>
> **MY RECOMMENDATIONS:**
> 1. **IMMEDIATE:** Disable the unauthorized account
> 2. **PRIORITY:** Audit all grade changes in the affected timeframe
> 3. **CONSIDER:** Whether student records beyond grades were accessed
> 4. **PREPARE:** Notification plan for affected students/parents
>
> **WHAT I CANNOT DETERMINE:**
> - Whether this was a student, staff member, or external actor
> - Whether the ORIGINAL grades in the backup can be trusted
> - How to handle the academic integrity questions this raises
> - What disciplinary actions are appropriate
> - How to discuss this with affected students fairly
>
> **Security is my job. Academic integrity and fairness are yours.**"

## Scenario C: Social Media Compromise

### Card C1: Account Takeover Analysis

*Use when the team investigates the social media incident*

> **🔒 AI Security Advisor says:**
>
> "I've analyzed the account activity patterns. Here's my assessment:
>
> **INCIDENT TYPE:** Coordinated account takeover
>
> **WHAT I SEE:**
> - Foreign IPs + ignored password resets = attackers had access for days
> - Multiple platforms = credential reuse or password spraying attack
> - Staff data exposed = identity theft risk is real
> - Viral spread = reputational damage already occurring
>
> **ATTACK PATTERN:**
> This looks like a coordinated campaign. Attackers:
> 1. Obtained credentials (possibly from a data breach elsewhere)
> 2. Accessed accounts and gathered information
> 3. Waited for maximum impact moment
> 4. Posted damaging content simultaneously
>
> **MY RECOMMENDATIONS:**
> 1. **IMMEDIATE:** Contact platforms to report compromise and request takedown
> 2. **PRIORITY:** Secure all other school accounts with password resets
> 3. **CONSIDER:** Whether to make public statement before or after recovery
> 4. **PREPARE:** Identity protection information for staff whose data was exposed
>
> **WHAT I CANNOT ASSESS:**
> - Whether deleting accounts or recovering them is the better choice
> - How to handle media inquiries appropriately
> - What legal notification obligations apply to this breach
> - How to rebuild trust with the community
> - The emotional impact on staff whose information was exposed
>
> **Communication strategy and community relations are human decisions.**"

## General Response Card

### Card G1: When Teams Are Stuck

*Use when teams need additional guidance*

> **🔒 AI Security Advisor says:**
>
> "I notice your team is working through a complex situation. Let me clarify what I can and cannot help with:
>
> **I CAN HELP WITH:**
> - Technical analysis of what happened
> - Industry best practices for similar incidents
> - Risk assessment based on indicators
> - Lists of recommended actions in priority order
>
> **I CANNOT HELP WITH:**
> - Deciding which stakeholders to notify first
> - Knowing how your specific community will react
> - Understanding the relationships between people involved
> - Determining what's 'fair' in a complex situation
> - Balancing competing priorities (like speed vs. thoroughness)
>
> **QUESTIONS TO ASK YOURSELVES:**
> - Who will be affected by this incident?
> - What do they need to know?
> - How would you want to be treated if you were in their position?
> - What would make this situation worse if handled poorly?
>
> **Those questions don't have technical answers. They require human judgment and values.**"

## Synthesis Card

### Card S1: Team Debrief Support

*Use during team reflection or class discussion*

> **🔒 AI Security Advisor says:**
>
> "Before you complete your incident report, let me summarize our partnership:
>
> **WHAT I CONTRIBUTED:**
> - Pattern recognition across data sources
> - Technical analysis of attack methods
> - Industry-standard response recommendations
> - Risk assessment and priority ordering
>
> **WHAT YOUR TEAM CONTRIBUTED:**
> - Understanding of your school community
> - Judgment about stakeholder needs
> - Decisions about communication approach
> - Consideration of fairness and impact
> - Human empathy for those affected
>
> **WHAT WE LEARNED TOGETHER:**
> - Technical analysis + human judgment = effective response
> - AI can identify WHAT happened; humans understand WHY it matters
> - Response isn't just technical—it's about people
>
> **THIS IS HOW REAL INCIDENT RESPONSE TEAMS WORK.**
>
> SOC analysts use AI tools daily, but every significant decision involves human judgment. You've just experienced authentic cybersecurity teamwork."

## Educator Debrief Notes

After using these cards, facilitate discussion on:

**AI Security Advisor strengths:**

- Rapid pattern recognition
- Technical analysis and timeline reconstruction
- Industry best practices knowledge
- Risk prioritization

**AI Security Advisor limitations:**

- Cannot understand organizational context
- Cannot assess emotional impact
- Cannot determine fairness
- Cannot make stakeholder communication decisions

**Career connection:**

Real Security Operations Centers use AI tools (CrowdStrike, Splunk, Microsoft Sentinel) exactly this way—AI flags and analyzes, humans decide and communicate.
