## Card 1: What Sparky Found

*Use during Scene 2: Robot Helper Checks*

> **🤖 Sparky the Robot Helper says:**
>
> "Beep boop! You asked me to check the computers. Let me see...
>
> ✓ The computers are plugged in — CHECK!
>
> ✓ The power strips have lights — CHECK!
>
> ✗ Wait! The main switch is... OFF!
>
> **I found the problem!**
>
> The big switch that gives power to all the computers is turned off. That's why nothing is working!
>
> But... I'm not allowed to flip the switch by myself. I need the Fix It Team to decide if it's safe first!"

**Teacher note:** Sparky finds the problem quickly but immediately defers to humans for the decision.

## Card 2: Why Sparky Needs Permission

*Use after Scene 2 when discussing why Sparky can't just fix it*

> **🤖 Sparky explains:**
>
> "Beep boop! You might be wondering why I didn't just flip the switch myself. Here's why:
>
> ❓ **What if someone's stuff was in the way?**
> I can't see backpacks or papers that might be near the switch.
>
> ❓ **What if there was a reason it was turned off?**
> Maybe a grown-up turned it off for a good reason I don't know about.
>
> ❓ **What if I made a mistake?**
> What if it wasn't really the switch? I could make things worse!
>
> **That's why people and robot helpers work together!**
>
> I find things. You decide things. We're a team!"

**Teacher note:** This card explains Sparky's limitations in kid-friendly terms.

## Card 3: Teamwork Celebration

*Use during Scene 4: Success!*

> **🤖 Sparky celebrates:**
>
> "Beep boop! HOORAY! The computers are working!
>
> **Look what our team did:**
>
> 🔍 The **Detective** looked for clues
>
> 💭 The **Thinker** had great ideas
>
> ✋ The **Helper** flipped the switch
>
> 🤖 And **I** (Sparky!) checked things really fast
>
> **Nobody could do it alone!**
>
> - I'm good at checking things quickly
> - But I needed YOU to decide what was safe
> - And I needed YOU to actually fix it
>
> **We're the best Fix It Team!**
>
> Beep boop! 🎉"

**Teacher note:** Reinforce that every team member—including the robot—contributed something important.

## Optional: If the Team Gets Stuck

*Use if students aren't sure what to do after Sparky finds the problem*

> **🤖 Sparky wonders:**
>
> "Beep boop! I found that the switch is off. But I don't know what to do next.
>
> Can the Fix It Team help me?
>
> - Should we flip the switch?
> - Should we ask the teacher first?
> - Should we check if it's safe?
>
> **What do you think, friends?**"

**Teacher note:** Use this to prompt student decision-making if they're waiting for the "answer."

## Debrief Discussion Prompts

After the activity, ask students:

**About Sparky:**

- "What was Sparky good at?" (Checking things fast, remembering what to look for)
- "What did Sparky need help with?" (Deciding, knowing if it was safe)

**About the team:**

- "What was the Detective's job?" (Looking for clues)
- "What was the Thinker's job?" (Coming up with ideas)
- "What was the Helper's job?" (Doing the fix)

**The big idea:**

- "Who fixed the computers—Sparky or the team?"
- (Answer: We did it TOGETHER! Sparky found the problem, but the team decided and did the fix.)
