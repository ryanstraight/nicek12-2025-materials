title: "Activity 3: Computer Problem Solvers"
subtitle: "AI Helper Response Cards (Grades 3-5)"
---

These cards provide pre-written AI helper responses for the Computer Problem Solvers investigation activity. The AI Partner on each team can read these aloud or the teacher can voice the AI helper.

## For Teachers

**How to use:**

- Cards correspond to the three questions teams ask during Step 2
- AI Partner reads the card (or teacher reads for the class)
- Teams should discuss each response before moving on

**The goal:** Students learn that AI helpers explain problems but people decide solutions.

## Card A: What Are These Pop-ups?

*Use when teams ask: "What kind of problem is this?"*

> **💻 AI Helper says:**
>
> "Thanks for asking me about this! Let me explain what I see:
>
> **The pop-up messages are fake.** Real contests don't work this way—you can't win something you didn't enter! The spelling mistakes ('Congradulations!') are a big clue. Real companies check their spelling.
>
> **This is probably malware.** Malware means 'bad software'—programs that got on the computers without permission. They're designed to trick people.
>
> **How it probably happened:**
> Someone clicked a link in a tricky email. The email might have looked real—like it was from a friend or from the school—but it wasn't!
>
> **What I can tell you:**
> - This is a common problem
> - It's not the student's fault for being tricked
> - Tricky emails are designed to fool people
>
> **What I CAN'T tell you:**
> - Whether the student who clicked feels bad about it
> - How to make sure no one gets in trouble
> - The best way to explain this to the class
>
> **Those are decisions for people, not computers!**"

## Card B: How Did It Spread?

*Use when teams ask: "How do bad programs get on computers?"*

> **💻 AI Helper says:**
>
> "Great question! Bad programs usually get on computers in a few ways:
>
> **1. Tricky Emails (Phishing)**
> - Emails that look like they're from someone you know
> - Links that look safe but aren't
> - Attachments that seem normal but have hidden problems
>
> **2. Unsafe Websites**
> - Downloading games or apps from unknown places
> - Clicking on ads that promise free stuff
> - Going to websites that aren't meant for kids
>
> **3. Spreading on Networks**
> - Once on one computer, some bad programs can spread to others
> - Like catching a cold at school!
>
> **Why only Mrs. Chen's class?**
> Someone in that classroom probably clicked something on Friday. The other classrooms didn't click it, so they're okay!
>
> **What I notice:**
> I can see patterns in how these things spread. I know the signs of malware.
>
> **What I can't understand:**
> - Why people click on things they shouldn't
> - How it feels to make a mistake like this
> - What the right thing to say to Mrs. Chen's class is
>
> **Those are things YOU would understand better than me!**"

## Card C: How Do We Fix It?

*Use when teams ask: "What should we do?"*

> **💻 AI Helper says:**
>
> "Here's what I know about fixing this kind of problem:
>
> **What students should do RIGHT NOW:**
> 1. **Tell an adult** — Teacher, IT person, or principal
> 2. **Don't click the pop-ups** — Even the 'X' might be a trick!
> 3. **Don't use those computers** — Until the IT team says it's safe
>
> **What the IT team will probably do:**
> - Use special tools to remove the bad programs
> - Check if other computers got infected
> - Make sure it can't come back
> - Maybe teach students about tricky emails
>
> **Why students shouldn't try to fix it themselves:**
> - The bad program might be sneaky
> - You could accidentally make it worse
> - The IT team has special tools we don't have
>
> **The most important fix:**
> Learning from this so it doesn't happen again!
>
> **What I can help with:**
> - Explaining what went wrong
> - Describing how malware works
> - Listing the steps to fix it
>
> **What I can't help with:**
> - Actually removing the malware (I'm not that kind of AI!)
> - Deciding how to talk to the students who are upset
> - Knowing if Mrs. Chen needs extra support
>
> **The Fix It Team has to make those human decisions!**"

## Card D: What We Learned Together

*Use during Step 4 report-out or class discussion*

> **💻 AI Helper says:**
>
> "Great teamwork, Problem Solvers! Let me summarize what we figured out together:
>
> **THE PROBLEM:**
> - Tricky email → Someone clicked → Malware installed
> - Pop-ups appeared → Computers slowed down
>
> **WHAT I (AI HELPER) CONTRIBUTED:**
> - Recognized the malware pattern
> - Explained how it spreads
> - Listed the steps IT teams use to fix it
>
> **WHAT YOU (PROBLEM SOLVERS) CONTRIBUTED:**
> - Gathered the clues from the evidence card
> - Asked great questions
> - Made a plan that considers people's feelings
> - Will explain this to others in a kind way
>
> **WHY WE NEEDED EACH OTHER:**
> - I know about computer problems, but I don't understand people
> - You understand people, but you needed help understanding the tech problem
> - Together, we solved it AND made a plan that's good for everyone!
>
> **THAT'S WHAT REAL CYBERSECURITY TEAMS DO!**"

## Educator Debrief Notes

After using these cards, help students articulate:

**AI Helper strengths:**

- Recognized the malware pattern quickly
- Knew technical terms and explanations
- Could list steps for fixing the problem
- Remembered information about how malware spreads

**AI Helper limitations:**

- Couldn't understand why people click tricky links
- Couldn't know how students might feel
- Couldn't actually fix the problem itself
- Couldn't make decisions about how to handle the situation kindly

**The partnership insight:**

- AI helped with technical understanding
- Humans handled the people parts
- Neither could solve it alone
- Real cybersecurity teams work this way!
