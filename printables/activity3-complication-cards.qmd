## How to Use These Cards

During Phase 3 (Response Execution), inject complications every 5 minutes to simulate the dynamic nature of real incidents. Start with milder complications and escalate as appropriate.

**Tips:**

- Read the complication aloud to the team
- Give them 30 seconds to react before moving on
- Don't inject complications if a team is already struggling
- The goal is adaptation practice, not team breakdown
