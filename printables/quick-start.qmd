## The Big Idea (Read This First)

This isn't "students use AI to solve a mystery." It's **students discovering what happens when two different kinds of intelligence work together**.

**The shift:**

| Old Framing | This Activity |
|-------------|---------------|
| AI is a tool students use | AI is a partner with different strengths |
| Students get answers from AI | Students discover what each partner contributes |
| Human OR AI | Human AND AI together |

**What students should discover** (don't tell them—let them find it):

- AI excels at: spotting patterns across data, remembering technical details, processing large volumes of information quickly
- Humans excel at: understanding context, reading social situations, making judgment calls about what matters
- Together: insights neither could reach alone

## The Scenario (2 min)

Mysterious account lockouts at a middle school. Students investigate with an AI partner to figure out what's happening.

**Evidence includes:** Login logs, password analysis, social media clues, network data.

## The Flow (45 min total)

| Phase | Time | What's Happening | Your Role |
|-------|------|------------------|-----------|
| **1. Human First** | 10 min | Students examine evidence WITHOUT AI | Circulate, prompt observation |
| **2. Partnership** | 15 min | Students consult AI as teammate | Guide authentic dialogue (not search queries) |
| **3. Synthesis** | 10 min | Teams document what each partner contributed | Push for specifics |
| **4. Debrief** | 10 min | Whole-class discussion | Surface the distributed cognition insight |

## Critical Facilitation Moves

**During Phase 1 (Human First):**

> "What do YOU notice before asking anyone else?"

This matters because students need to experience their own pattern-recognition before comparing it to AI's.

**During Phase 2 (Partnership):**

> "Talk TO your AI partner, not AT it. Ask follow-ups. Disagree if you think it's wrong."

Watch for: Students treating AI like Google. Redirect: "Would you talk to a human teammate that way?"

**During Phase 3 (Synthesis):**

> "Be specific: What did YOUR brain do that AI couldn't? What did AI do that you couldn't?"

This is where the partnership insight crystallizes.

## Materials Needed

- [ ] Evidence packet (1 per group) — *see separate printable*
- [ ] Student worksheet (1 per student) — *see separate printable*
- [ ] Device with AI access (1 per group minimum)
- [ ] Timer
- [ ] Projection for debrief

**Low-resource option:** Use the AI Response Cards instead of live AI. The learning works the same way.

## The Debrief Questions That Matter

1. "What did your human brain catch that AI missed?" *(Context, social reading, judgment)*
2. "What did AI catch that you missed?" *(Patterns, technical connections, speed)*
3. "What did you figure out TOGETHER that neither could alone?" *(This is the goal)*

## If Things Go Wrong

| Problem | It's Actually | Do This |
|---------|---------------|---------|
| AI gives wrong answer | A teaching moment about verification | "Interesting—how would you check that?" |
| Students over-rely on AI | They haven't discovered AI's limits yet | "What CAN'T AI tell you about this situation?" |
| Students dismiss AI | They haven't discovered AI's strengths yet | "What's AI faster at noticing than you?" |
