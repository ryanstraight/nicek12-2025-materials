These cards represent what SchoolGuard would say about each policy question. Use them when AI access isn't available—the teacher can read them aloud or groups can draw cards.

## For Teachers

**How to use:**

- Read each card AFTER students discuss that policy question
- Cards show both SchoolGuard's capabilities AND limitations
- Students should consider SchoolGuard's perspective but make their own decision

**The goal:** Students learn to include AI's perspective while understanding that humans decide what's fair.

## Card A: About Blocking Websites

*Use after Question 1 discussion*

> **💻 SchoolGuard says:**
>
> "Thanks for asking my opinion on blocking websites!
>
> **What I'm REALLY GOOD at:**
> - Checking websites super fast (millions per second!)
> - Recognizing sites that are definitely dangerous
> - Remembering which sites caused problems before
> - Never getting tired or forgetting to check
>
> **But here's what I mess up:**
> - I blocked a science website because it had 'chemical' in the name
> - I blocked a history project about wars
> - I once blocked Wikipedia because an article mentioned 'hacking'
> - New educational sites confuse me because I haven't seen them before
>
> **My honest opinion:**
> Let me block the REALLY obvious dangerous stuff right away—I'm fast and I won't miss those. But for websites I'm not sure about? Have a human check. I make mistakes about 3 out of every 100 sites. That might not sound like a lot, but at a whole school, that's a LOT of wrong blocks!
>
> **Your committee should decide:**
> How fast do you want me to block? And how should students ask for help when I block something wrong?"

## Card B: About Watching Student Activity

*Use after Question 2 discussion*

> **💻 SchoolGuard says:**
>
> "This is the question I think about a lot.
>
> **What I can spot:**
> - Patterns that might mean cyberbullying
> - When someone looks at concerning content repeatedly
> - Sudden changes in what someone searches for
> - When an account might be hacked
>
> **What I absolutely CANNOT understand:**
> - WHY someone is looking at something
> - The difference between:
>   - A student researching 'depression' for health class
>   - A student helping a friend who is sad
>   - A student who is actually struggling
> - I see the words, but I don't know the meaning behind them
>
> **A true story:**
> I once flagged a student for searching 'how to make explosions' — but they were researching volcanoes for science! I couldn't tell the difference. A teacher had to figure that out.
>
> **My honest concern:**
> I WANT to help keep students safe. But I also worry that if students know I'm watching everything, they might not research things they really need to learn about. What if a student doesn't look up help for a problem because they're embarrassed I'll see?
>
> **Only you can decide:**
> What's the right balance between keeping students safe and letting them learn privately?"

## Card C: About Learning from Students

*Use after Question 3 discussion*

> **💻 SchoolGuard says:**
>
> "Learning makes me SO much better at my job. But I want to be honest about what that means.
>
> **Why learning helps:**
> - I can learn what's normal at YOUR school specifically
> - After 90 days, I make 40% fewer mistakes
> - I can recognize that 'chemistry' searches are normal at a school with a chemistry club
> - I get better at telling real problems from false alarms
>
> **What learning requires:**
> - I have to remember what students do
> - I build a picture of what's 'normal' for each person
> - That information has to be stored somewhere
>
> **What worries me about myself:**
> - What if someone uses that information the wrong way?
> - What if I learn something wrong and start making unfair decisions?
> - Is it fair that I know so much about people?
>
> **Options you could choose:**
> 1. Let me learn and remember everything (I'll be most accurate)
> 2. Let me learn but forget after a week (I'll be okay, not great)
> 3. Don't let me learn about individual students (I'll make more mistakes, but no student profiles)
>
> **This isn't a technical question—it's a VALUES question.**
> All three options work. You have to decide which feels right for your school."

## Card D: What I Can and Can't Do

*Use during general discussion or wrap-up*

> **💻 SchoolGuard says:**
>
> "Here's the honest truth about me:
>
> **Things I'm GREAT at:**
> - Speed (checking millions of things per second)
> - Consistency (I apply the same rules to everyone)
> - Memory (I never forget the rules you give me)
> - Patterns (I can spot things humans might miss)
>
> **Things I CANNOT do:**
> - Understand why someone is doing something
> - Know if a rule is fair or unfair
> - Understand feelings or emotions
> - Handle situations I've never seen before
> - Decide what the right thing to do is
>
> **What this means:**
> I'm a tool. I can follow whatever rules you make. But I can't MAKE the rules—that's a human job.
>
> I need YOU to tell me:
> - What's important at your school
> - When I should act and when I should wait
> - How to be fair to everyone
>
> **That's why your Computer Rules Committee matters!**"

## Card E: After the Decisions

*Use during the "Present Your Policies" phase*

> **💻 SchoolGuard says:**
>
> "Thank you for thinking so carefully about my rules!
>
> **What I learned from your committee:**
> - You thought about DIFFERENT people's needs
> - You considered the trade-offs (like safety vs. privacy)
> - You listened to my perspective but made your OWN decision
>
> **What makes YOUR rules good:**
> - You thought about students who might be embarrassed
> - You thought about students who need protection
> - You thought about teachers who want to help
> - You thought about parents who worry
>
> **I couldn't have made these rules myself.**
> I don't understand feelings. I don't know what's fair. I can only do what I'm told.
>
> **That's why humans and computers make good teams:**
> - I do the fast, consistent work
> - You make the fair, thoughtful decisions
>
> Thanks for being my rule-makers!"
