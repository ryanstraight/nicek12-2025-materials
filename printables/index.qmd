## Activity 1: Security Detective Teams

Students investigate security incidents WITH an AI partner, discovering that AI excels at pattern recognition while humans bring contextual understanding.

### Educator Materials

[**Quick-Start Guide**](quick-start.qmd) — Activity overview, timing, facilitation moves, and debrief questions.

### Student Worksheets

[**Investigation Worksheet**](student-worksheet.qmd) — The main student-facing document guiding students through human-first investigation, AI partnership, and reflection. *(Grades 6-8 baseline; adapt language for other bands)*

### Support Materials

[**Evidence Packet**](evidence-packet.qmd) — "CLASSIFIED" investigation evidence including login logs, password analysis, social media activity, network data, help desk tickets, and interview notes.

[**AI Partner Response Cards**](ai-response-cards.qmd) — Low-resource implementation support with pre-written AI analysis for groups without live AI access.
