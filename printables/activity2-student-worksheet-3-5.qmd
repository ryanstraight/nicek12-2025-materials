## Welcome to the Computer Rules Committee!

Your school is getting "SchoolGuard," a new computer system that helps keep students safe online. The principal wants STUDENTS to help decide the rules!

**What SchoolGuard Can Do:**

- See what websites students visit on school computers
- Block websites it thinks are dangerous
- Send alerts to teachers about student activity
- Learn what's "normal" and flag unusual things

## Question 1: Blocking Websites

**Should SchoolGuard automatically block websites it thinks are bad?**

### My Choice:

[ ] **Option A:** Block everything SchoolGuard thinks is bad

[ ] **Option B:** Block dangerous sites, but let students request unblocks

[ ] **Option C:** Only block if a teacher agrees

**Why I chose this:**

## Question 2: Watching Student Activity

**Should SchoolGuard watch what students do and tell teachers?**

### My Choice:

[ ] **Option A:** Watch everything and alert teachers automatically

[ ] **Option B:** Watch but only alert for serious safety concerns

[ ] **Option C:** Don't watch individual students at all

**Why I chose this:**

**How would I feel if I knew SchoolGuard was watching me?**

## Question 3: Learning from Students

**Should SchoolGuard learn what's "normal" at our school?**

### My Choice:

[ ] **Option A:** Yes, SchoolGuard should learn and remember

[ ] **Option B:** SchoolGuard can learn but must forget after one week

[ ] **Option C:** SchoolGuard shouldn't learn about specific students

**Why I chose this:**
