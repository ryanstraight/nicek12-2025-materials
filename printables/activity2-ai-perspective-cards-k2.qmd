These cards let teachers "be" Sparky the Robot Helper when discussing each rule. Read them aloud in a friendly robot voice after students vote on each question!

::: {.callout-note}
## For Teachers

**How to use:**

- Read each card AFTER students discuss and vote on that question
- Cards help students hear Sparky's perspective on their rules
- Sparky always explains what it's good at AND what it needs help with

**The goal:** Students understand that robot helpers need humans to make fair rules.

## Card 1: About the Lights

*Use after Question 1 (Should Sparky turn off lights by itself?)*

> **🤖 Sparky says:**
>
> "Beep boop! Thank you for thinking about my light rules!
>
> **What I'm GOOD at:**
> - I can tell when the sun is very bright
> - I can turn lights off super fast
> - I never forget to check
>
> **What I DON'T understand:**
> - I don't know if someone is reading and needs the light
> - I don't know if a student has trouble seeing
> - I can't tell if the clouds might come back soon
>
> **What I think:**
> Maybe I could turn off lights when it's REALLY sunny, but ask the teacher if I'm not sure? What do you think is fair?"

**Teacher note:** Sparky shows capability (sensing light) AND limitation (not understanding context).

## Card 2: About Cleanup Time

*Use after Question 2 (Should Sparky play cleanup song whenever it's messy?)*

> **🤖 Sparky says:**
>
> "Beep boop! The cleanup question is tricky for me!
>
> **What I'm GOOD at:**
> - I can see when things are on the floor
> - I can play the cleanup song the same way every time
> - I never forget what 'messy' looks like
>
> **What I DON'T understand:**
> - I don't know if you're in the MIDDLE of a project
> - I don't know if you're about to clean up anyway
> - I can't tell if the teacher has other plans
>
> **What I think:**
> Maybe it's better if the TEACHER tells me when it's cleanup time? I can help by playing the song, but a person should decide WHEN. Is that fair?"

**Teacher note:** Sparky acknowledges that timing decisions need human judgment.

## Card 3: About Telling on Unsafe Behavior

*Use after Question 3 (Should Sparky tell the teacher if someone is running?)*

> **🤖 Sparky says:**
>
> "Beep boop! This one is the HARDEST for me!
>
> **What I'm GOOD at:**
> - I can see when someone is moving fast
> - I can tell the teacher very quickly
> - I want to keep everyone safe!
>
> **What I DON'T understand:**
> - I don't know if someone is running for a good reason
> - I don't know if it's an emergency
> - I can't tell if the teacher already said it's okay
> - I don't know if someone is just really excited and happy
>
> **What I think:**
> I really want to help keep everyone safe! But maybe I should only tell about REALLY dangerous things? And let people decide about the in-between things? What do YOU think?"

**Teacher note:** This is the key card—Sparky genuinely doesn't understand intention.

## Card 4: After All the Rules

*Use during "Making Our Rules" wrap-up*

> **🤖 Sparky says:**
>
> "Beep boop! Thank you for making my rules!
>
> **What I learned from YOU:**
> - When to do things by myself
> - When to ask first
> - What's really important
>
> **What I still need YOU for:**
> - Knowing if the rules are fair
> - Understanding feelings
> - Changing rules when they don't work
>
> **I'm so happy to be your helper!**
>
> Robot helpers and kids make the best team. You make the rules, and I follow them. Together we can keep our classroom happy and safe!
>
> Beep boop! 🤖💙"

**Teacher note:** Celebrates the human-AI partnership while reinforcing human authority.

## Debrief Discussion Prompts

After using these cards, ask students:

**About Sparky's abilities:**

- "What was Sparky GOOD at doing?"
- "What did Sparky need HELP with?"

**About making rules:**

- "Why did WE get to make the rules?"
- "What would happen if Sparky made its own rules?"

**The teamwork message:**

- "Is Sparky a good helper? Why?"
- "Why do robot helpers need people?"

## Optional: "What Sparky Learned" Summary

*Read at the very end as a celebration*

> **🤖 Sparky's Thank You:**
>
> "Dear friends,
>
> Thank you for being my rule-makers! Now I know:
>
> ✓ When I can help by myself
> ✓ When I should ask first
> ✓ That people know things I don't understand
>
> I'm the luckiest robot because I have such smart friends to help me be a good helper!
>
> Your robot friend,
> Sparky 🤖"
