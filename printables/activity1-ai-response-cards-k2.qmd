These cards let teachers "be" the Robot Helper when live AI isn't available. Read them aloud in a friendly robot voice!

::: {.callout-note}
## For Teachers

**How to use:**

- Read cards aloud when students ask the Robot Helper for help
- Use a fun "robot voice" if you like!
- Cards go in order: Card 1 → Card 2 → Card 3

**The goal:** Students discover that Robot Helper is good at *finding things*, but needs human help understanding *feelings* and *why* things happened.

## Card 1: What Robot Helper Found

*Use this card after showing students the clues*

> **Robot Helper says:**
>
> "Beep boop! Hello, detective friends! You asked me to help find the missing class pet picture. Let me look at the clues...
>
> 🔍 I see the recycling bin icon is FULL!
>
> 🗑️ When files get deleted on a computer, they go to the recycling bin.
>
> 💡 I think the picture might be IN the recycling bin!
>
> Should we check there together?"

**Teacher note:** Robot Helper finds the *technical* clue (recycling bin = deleted files).

## Card 2: Robot Helper Needs Your Help

*Use this card after students notice the "oops" note*

> **Robot Helper says:**
>
> "Beep boop! You found a note that says 'oops' near the computer. Hmm...
>
> 🤔 I don't understand this note.
>
> ❓ Why would someone write 'oops'?
>
> ❓ Do you think someone feels bad about something?
>
> ❓ Was it an accident or on purpose?
>
> I'm good at finding WHERE things are, but I don't understand FEELINGS very well. Can you help me understand what 'oops' means?"

**Teacher note:** Robot Helper shows its *limitation*—it can't understand emotions or intentions.

## Card 3: We Did It Together!

*Use this card after finding the picture in the recycling bin*

> **Robot Helper says:**
>
> "Beep boop! HOORAY! We found the picture!
>
> 🤖 **What I helped with:**
> - I knew deleted files go to the recycling bin
> - I helped you look in the right place
>
> 👧👦 **What YOU helped with:**
> - You understood the 'oops' note meant someone felt sorry
> - You figured out it was probably an accident
> - You knew someone was at the computer during snack time
>
> 🎉 **TOGETHER** we solved the mystery!
>
> Robot helpers and human friends make a great team!"

**Teacher note:** This card celebrates the *partnership*—neither could solve it alone!

## Debrief Discussion Prompts

After the activity, ask students:

**What Robot Helper did well:**

- "What did Robot Helper remember about computers?"
- "What did Robot Helper help us find?"

**What WE did well:**

- "What did Robot Helper NOT understand?"
- "How did we help Robot Helper?"

**The teamwork message:**

- "Who solved the mystery—Robot Helper or us?"
- "Why are we better TOGETHER?"
