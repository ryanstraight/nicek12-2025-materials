title: "Activity 1: Security Detective Teams"
subtitle: "AI Security Analyst Response Cards (Grades 9-12)"
---

These cards simulate an AI Security Analyst from a Security Operations Center (SOC). The language reflects professional security analyst communication—technical but collaborative.

::: {.callout-note}
## For Instructors

**How to use:**

- Cards can be drawn in sequence (A → B → C → D → E) or selectively based on investigation flow
- Students should document which cards they received and how AI analysis shaped their conclusions
- Emphasize that the AI explicitly states its limitations—a critical learning point

**The goal:** Students experience authentic SOC AI collaboration—pattern recognition AND explicit limitation acknowledgment.

## Card Set A: Initial Alert Analysis

*Use when students first engage AI with the evidence package*

### Card A: SIEM Pattern Detection

> **AI Security Analyst reports:**
>
> "Acknowledged. Analyzing evidence package for Incident #APEX-2024-1114.
>
> **AUTHENTICATION ANOMALY DETECTED:**
>
> ```
> Pattern: Credential access attempts from 185.42.x.x
> Time window: 02:34-02:42 UTC (off-hours)
> Affected accounts: jmorris@apex, kpatel@apex
> MFA status: Multiple failures, one bypass via legacy auth
> Confidence: HIGH
> ```
>
> **GEOLOCATION ANALYSIS:**
> - IP 185.42.x.x resolves to Eastern European infrastructure
> - Normal user baseline: US-based IP ranges (10.x.x.x, 192.168.x.x)
> - Anomaly score: 94th percentile
>
> **TIMELINE CORRELATION:**
> - 02:34:12 - First jmorris attempt (MFA failed)
> - 02:35:22 - jmorris SUCCESS via legacy auth bypass
> - 02:36:01 - File access initiated (Finance/Q3Reports)
>
> **Initial assessment:** Credential compromise with successful MFA bypass exploitation.
>
> **Request to analyst team:** What organizational context should I consider? I don't have visibility into HR data or business operations."

## Card Set B: Threat Intelligence Correlation

*Use when students ask about the IP address or attack attribution*

### Card B: IOC Matching and TTP Identification

> **AI Security Analyst reports:**
>
> "Cross-referencing indicators with threat intelligence feeds.
>
> **INDICATOR MATCH RESULTS:**
>
> | IOC | Match Confidence | Context |
> |-----|-----------------|---------|
> | 185.42.x.x | HIGH | Known credential stuffing infrastructure |
> | apex-login[.]com | HIGH | Typosquatting domain, registered 11/10 |
> | Legacy auth exploit | HIGH | Trending TTP Q4 2024 |
>
> **MITRE ATT&CK MAPPING:**
>
> - **Initial Access:** T1566.001 (Spearphishing Attachment) - Probable based on email evidence
> - **Persistence:** T1078.001 (Valid Accounts: Default Accounts) - Legacy auth exploitation
> - **Collection:** T1005 (Data from Local System) - SharePoint file access
>
> **CAMPAIGN ATTRIBUTION:**
> This TTP chain matches patterns associated with Business Email Compromise (BEC) precursor campaigns. Typical objective: Financial data exfiltration or wire fraud preparation.
>
> **Confidence level:** MEDIUM-HIGH. Attribution is probabilistic, not definitive.
>
> **Limitation notice:** I cannot assess whether this is targeted specifically at Apex or opportunistic. That requires organizational context I lack."

## Card Set C: Evidence Synthesis

*Use when students ask for attack timeline or scope assessment*

### Card C: Attack Chain Reconstruction

> **AI Security Analyst reports:**
>
> "Synthesizing evidence across all sources. Reconstructed attack chain:
>
> **TIMELINE:**
>
> ```
> Nov 10 - Typosquatting domain apex-login[.]com registered (PREPARATION)
> Nov 12 - Phishing emails sent to Finance department (DELIVERY)
>        - jmorris: Delivered (user override)
>        - kpatel: Delivered (user override)
>        - tkim: Quarantined (no override)
> Nov 14 02:34 - Credential use from malicious IP (EXPLOITATION)
> Nov 14 02:35 - MFA bypass via legacy authentication (INSTALLATION)
> Nov 14 02:36 - SharePoint Finance access (ACTIONS ON OBJECTIVES)
> ```
>
> **SCOPE ASSESSMENT:**
>
> | Account | Compromise Status | Data Access |
> |---------|------------------|-------------|
> | jmorris@apex | CONFIRMED | Q3 Financial Reports |
> | kpatel@apex | ATTEMPTED | None (MFA blocked) |
> | tkim@apex | NOT COMPROMISED | N/A |
>
> **RECOMMENDED TECHNICAL ACTIONS:**
>
> 1. Disable legacy authentication protocols immediately
> 2. Force credential reset for jmorris@apex
> 3. Block IP range 185.42.x.x at perimeter
> 4. Audit all file access from jmorris account Nov 12-14
>
> **Query for analyst team:** Evidence suggests users overrode email security warnings. Why would they do that? This is critical context I cannot determine from logs."

## Card Set D: Explicit Limitations

*Use when students need to understand what AI cannot assess*

### Card D: Limitation Notice

> **AI Security Analyst reports:**
>
> "Transparency notice: The following assessments are BEYOND MY CAPABILITY and require human analyst judgment.
>
> **CANNOT ASSESS — HR/Insider Risk Context:**
>
> The HR data indicates jmorris had a public disagreement with management and is actively job searching. I cannot determine:
>
> - Is jmorris a victim only, or potentially complicit?
> - Does the timing of compromise relate to workplace conflict?
> - What is appropriate HR/legal response?
>
> **CANNOT ASSESS — Organizational Culture:**
>
> Users jmorris and kpatel both overrode email security warnings. I cannot determine:
>
> - Why did they override? Time pressure? Training gaps? System distrust?
> - Is this behavior common at Apex?
> - What organizational factors enable this risk?
>
> **CANNOT ASSESS — Business Impact:**
>
> - How sensitive is Q3 Financial Reports data specifically?
> - What is the reputational impact if this becomes public?
> - What are the regulatory notification requirements?
>
> **CANNOT ASSESS — Response Proportionality:**
>
> - Should law enforcement be involved?
> - How should affected users be notified?
> - What is the appropriate balance between security and employee relations?
>
> **These are human judgment calls.** I provide technical analysis; you provide organizational wisdom."

## Card Set E: Verification Protocol

*Use when students are drawing conclusions and making recommendations*

### Card E: Human Analyst Verification Required

> **AI Security Analyst reports:**
>
> "Preparing for analyst handoff. Verification questions for your team:
>
> **CRITICAL QUESTION 1: Insider Risk Assessment**
>
> Based on HR context (job searching, management conflict), you must assess:
> - Is jmorris purely a phishing victim?
> - Could jmorris have intentionally provided credentials?
> - What is the appropriate level of HR involvement?
>
> *I cannot make this determination. Human judgment required.*
>
> **CRITICAL QUESTION 2: User Override Behavior**
>
> Two users overrode security warnings. Your assessment:
> - Training deficiency or willful bypass?
> - Disciplinary matter or process improvement opportunity?
> - How should this inform your recommendations?
>
> *I see the behavior; I cannot assess intent or appropriate response.*
>
> **CRITICAL QUESTION 3: Stakeholder Communication**
>
> CFO wants preliminary findings. You must decide:
> - How much detail is appropriate for executive briefing?
> - Should HR context be included in CFO communication?
> - What is your confidence level, and how do you express uncertainty?
>
> *Communication strategy is a human skill. I generate technical findings.*
>
> **FINAL SYNTHESIS:**
>
> | Analysis Dimension | AI Contribution | Human Contribution Required |
> |-------------------|-----------------|---------------------------|
> | Technical IOCs | ✓ Complete | Verification of action |
> | Attack timeline | ✓ Complete | Business impact overlay |
> | Insider risk | ✗ Cannot assess | HR context integration |
> | Response plan | Technical options | Organizational judgment |
> | Communication | Draft content | Stakeholder calibration |
>
> **Ready for your integrated assessment.**"

## Educator Debrief Notes

After using these cards, facilitate discussion on:

**AI Security Analyst strengths** (demonstrated in this activity):

- Rapid pattern recognition across log sources
- Threat intelligence correlation and IOC matching
- MITRE ATT&CK framework mapping
- Attack chain timeline reconstruction
- Systematic evidence synthesis

**AI Security Analyst limitations** (explicitly stated in cards):

- Cannot assess insider risk or HR context
- Cannot interpret organizational culture
- Cannot determine user intent behind behavior
- Cannot make proportionality judgments
- Cannot calibrate stakeholder communication

**Professional insight:**

Real SOC AI tools (CrowdStrike, Splunk SOAR, Microsoft Sentinel) exhibit exactly these patterns—strong technical correlation, explicit limitation acknowledgment. The "human-in-the-loop" model is industry standard, not just educational framing.

**Career connection:**

This activity mirrors actual SOC Tier 1/Tier 2 analyst work where AI flags anomalies and provides analysis, but human analysts add context, make decisions, and communicate with stakeholders.
