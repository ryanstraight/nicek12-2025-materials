## Rubric Overview

This rubric assesses students' understanding of how activity experiences connect to authentic cybersecurity careers as defined by the NICE Workforce Framework for Cybersecurity.

**Use with**: All three "True Teamwork" activities
**Point range**: 3-12 points (3 criteria × 1-4 points each)

## Assessment Criteria

### Criterion 1: Work Role Recognition (1-4 points)

| Score | Descriptor | Observable Behaviors |
|-------|------------|---------------------|
| **4 - Advanced** | Identifies multiple relevant Work Roles and distinguishes between them | Names specific roles; explains how different roles contribute differently; recognizes role boundaries |
| **3 - Proficient** | Identifies relevant Work Roles | Can name 1-2 roles that align with activity; understands basic role functions |
| **2 - Developing** | Partial role awareness | Vague references to cybersecurity jobs; doesn't use NICE terminology |
| **1 - Emerging** | No role recognition | Cannot connect activity to career pathways |

**NICE Framework Work Roles addressed in these activities**:

- Cyber Defense Analyst (PR-CDA-001)
- Incident Responder (PR-CIR-001)
- Vulnerability Assessment Analyst (PR-VAM-001)
- Cyber Policy and Strategy Planner (OV-SPP-002)

### Criterion 2: Real-World Connection (1-4 points)

|-------|------------|---------------------|
| **4 - Advanced** | Makes sophisticated connections to professional practice | Explains how professionals use similar skills; identifies where human-AI collaboration appears in real work |
| **3 - Proficient** | Connects activity to professional work | Recognizes activity mirrors real cybersecurity tasks; can give examples |
| **2 - Developing** | General awareness | Knows activity relates to "cybersecurity jobs" but lacks specificity |
| **1 - Emerging** | No connection made | Treats activity as purely academic exercise |

### Criterion 3: Skill Identification (1-4 points)

| Score | Descriptor | Observable Behaviors |
|-------|------------|---------------------|
| **4 - Advanced** | Identifies specific skills developed and how they apply to careers | Names technical and soft skills; explains transferability; recognizes human-AI collaboration as skill |
| **3 - Proficient** | Identifies relevant skills | Can name skills practiced; understands career relevance |
| **2 - Developing** | Partial skill awareness | Identifies some skills but may miss collaboration aspects |
| **1 - Emerging** | No skill identification | Cannot articulate what was learned |

**Skills demonstrated across activities**:

- Technical: Log analysis, incident response, policy development
- Collaboration: Human-AI partnership, team coordination
- Critical thinking: Evidence evaluation, decision-making under uncertainty
- Communication: Stakeholder communication, documentation

## Scoring Guide

| Total Score | Performance Level | Interpretation |
|-------------|------------------|----------------|
| 10-12 | Exemplary | Student demonstrates strong career awareness; consider mentorship or advanced opportunities |
| 7-9 | Proficient | Student understands career connections; encourage continued exploration |
| 4-6 | Developing | Student needs more explicit career connection instruction; provide additional resources |
