# You just designed security policies like a **Privacy Officer**!

## What You Did Today

Today you designed governance policies for an AI security system. You decided what the AI should do automatically versus what requires human approval. You balanced security benefits against privacy concerns—and discovered there's no easy "right answer."

**This is exactly what cybersecurity policy professionals do when organizations deploy AI systems.**

## The NICE Framework Work Role: Cyber Policy & Strategy Planner

### What Policy Planners Do

- **Design governance frameworks** for how AI systems operate
- **Balance competing concerns**: security, privacy, efficiency, fairness
- **Consult stakeholders** to understand different perspectives
- **Write policies** that guide technology decisions

### Key Tasks You Practiced

| What You Did | What Policy Teams Call It |
|-------------|----------------------|
| Decided what AI can do automatically | Automation governance |
| Balanced security vs. privacy | Risk-benefit analysis |
| Considered different stakeholder views | Stakeholder engagement |
| Made decisions without perfect answers | Policy development |
| Heard the AI's perspective | Technology assessment |

## Related Careers

## The Big Realization

### Why This Matters for AI

The decisions you made today—about what AI should do automatically versus ask humans first—are decisions organizations are making RIGHT NOW about AI systems.

**There are no easy answers.**

- More automation = faster protection, but more mistakes
- More human oversight = fewer errors, but slower response
- Every choice involves trade-offs

**The skills you practiced—weighing options, considering perspectives, making decisions under uncertainty—are exactly what cybersecurity policy careers require.**
