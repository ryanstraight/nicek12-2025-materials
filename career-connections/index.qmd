## Overview

Each activity connects directly to authentic cybersecurity work roles defined in the NICE Workforce Framework for Cybersecurity. These one-page handouts help students recognize how classroom activities relate to actual professional pathways in the field.

## Career Connection Handouts

### Activity 1: Security Detective Teams

**Primary Career**: Cyber Defense Analyst

Students investigate security incidents by analyzing login patterns, password weaknesses, and suspicious activity, performing exactly the kind of analysis that Cyber Defense Analysts conduct daily. Related careers include SOC Analyst, Digital Forensics Analyst, Vulnerability Analyst, and Threat Intelligence Analyst.

### Activity 2: AI-Assisted Incident Response

**Primary Career**: Incident Responder / SOC Analyst

Students coordinate response to security incidents in team roles, making time-critical decisions with AI support, directly mirroring the workflow of Security Operations Center professionals. Related careers include Incident Commander, Threat Intelligence Specialist, Security Engineer, and Security Communications.

### Activity 3: Ethics in Automated Security

**Primary Career**: Cyber Policy & Strategy Planner / Privacy Officer

Students design governance policies for AI security systems, balancing competing concerns in ways that reflect the core work of security governance professionals. Related careers include Security Governance Specialist, Risk Analyst, Compliance Manager, and Privacy Officer.

## Using Career Connections

### During Activities

Reference NICE work roles explicitly during activity introductions. Use career language when describing tasks, and point out moments when students are "doing what professional analysts do" in their investigations.

### During Debrief

Connect specific tasks to professional practices during debrief discussions. Discuss how AI collaboration appears in real cybersecurity work and encourage students to ask questions about career pathways.

### For Interested Students

Direct students seeking further exploration to the [NICE Framework Resource Center](https://www.nist.gov/itl/applied-cybersecurity/nice/nice-framework-resource-center), [CyberSeek Career Pathways](https://www.cyberseek.org/pathway.html), and local cybersecurity competitions such as CyberPatriot, NCL, and picoCTF.
