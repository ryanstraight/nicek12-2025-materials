# You just coordinated incident response like a **SOC Analyst**!

## What You Did Today

Today you responded to a realistic security incident as part of a team. You took on a specific role, whether Incident Commander, SOC Analyst, Threat Intelligence Specialist, or Communications Coordinator. You worked with AI to analyze the situation and made decisions under pressure.

This is exactly what Security Operations Center teams do when real incidents happen.

## The NICE Framework Work Role: Incident Responder

### What Incident Responders Do

- **Coordinate response** to cybersecurity events and breaches
- **Lead teams** with different specialties working together
- **Consult AI systems** for rapid threat analysis
- **Make time-critical decisions** about containment and recovery

### Key Tasks You Practiced

| What You Did | What Incident Teams Call It |
|-------------|----------------------|
| Assessed the situation as a team | Incident triage |
| Assigned roles and responsibilities | Response coordination |
| Used AI to analyze threats | Automated threat detection |
| Decided on actions to take | Incident containment |
| Communicated with stakeholders | Incident communication |

## Related Careers

**SOC Analyst**: First line of defense—monitors systems 24/7 and escalates potential incidents.

**Incident Commander**: Leads the response team during active incidents, making critical decisions.

**Threat Intelligence Specialist**: Researches attackers' tactics to inform response strategies.

**Security Engineer**: Builds and maintains the systems that detect and respond to threats.

## The Roles You Played

### Your Team Roles → Real Career Paths

| Activity Role | Real-World Career |
|--------------|-------------------|
| Incident Commander | Security Manager, CISO |
| SOC Analyst | Security Analyst, Tier 1-3 Analyst |
| Threat Intelligence | Threat Hunter, Intelligence Analyst |
| Communications Coordinator | Security Communications, PR |

**Every role matters.** Real incident response requires diverse skills working together.

## How Incident Response Teams Actually Work

## Industry Reality Check

In real Security Operations Centers, incident response is not a conversation with AI. Rather, it is a coordinated workflow where AI tools support human decision-making:

| Your Role Activity | Real-World Equivalent |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| Incident Commander made final calls | IR Managers coordinate response, authorize actions, and manage communication |
| SOC Analyst queried AI for analysis | Analysts review automated alerts from SIEM/XDR platforms and investigate with forensic tools |
| Threat Intelligence researched TTPs | Intel teams use MITRE ATT&CK, threat feeds, and AI-powered analysis to identify adversary patterns |
| Communications notified stakeholders | Crisis communication follows pre-planned playbooks while legal teams review disclosures |

The key insight is that real incidents happen fast. Teams practice with tabletop exercises like today's activity so that when real incidents occur, everyone knows their role. AI tools generate alerts and recommendations, but humans make the critical decisions about containment, communication, and recovery.
