## Instructor Overview

This extension activity challenges students to translate technical security findings into clear, actionable communication suitable for non-technical stakeholders. The exercise develops what practitioners recognize as one of the most consequential competencies in cybersecurity careers: the capacity to render complex technical analysis accessible to decision-makers whose expertise lies in other domains. Students discover through practice that technical proficiency, however sophisticated, achieves organizational impact only when paired with effective communication across disciplinary boundaries.

**Duration**: 25-35 minutes (standalone) or integrated into Activity 1 or 3 debrief
**Recommended Use**: After completing Security Detective Teams or SOC Analyst Simulation
**Grade Levels**: Primarily 9-12, adaptable for 6-8
**Technology**: Word processor or pen/paper
:::

## Learning Objectives

Through completing this challenge, students will develop facility in translating technical findings into accessible language while preserving analytical accuracy, distinguishing between information non-technical stakeholders need to know and information of secondary relevance, and applying executive summary writing conventions appropriate to organizational contexts. Students will recognize audience analysis as an essential security communication skill and understand how communication competency functions as a determinant of career advancement in cybersecurity fields.

### NICE Framework Connection

- **Technical Writing**: Documenting technical information for various audiences
- **Cybersecurity Management**: Communicating with organizational leadership
- **Security Awareness**: Explaining security concepts to non-specialists

## The Challenge

::: {.scenario-box}
### Your Assignment

You have just completed an investigation (from Activity 1 or 3). Your technical findings are solid, but now comes the harder part: explaining them to the principal.

**Principal Martinez's Profile**:

- Former English teacher, now school administrator
- Excellent with people, budgets, and policy
- Limited technical background (knows how to use email and spreadsheets)
- Responsible for communicating with parents, school board, and media
- Needs to make decisions about resources and response

**Your Task**: Create a one-page Executive Briefing that Principal Martinez can:

1. Understand completely in under 3 minutes
2. Use to answer parent questions
3. Base resource decisions on
4. Share with the school board if needed

## Translation Guide

### Common Technical Terms → Plain Language

| Technical | Plain Language |
|-----------|----------------|
| Malware | Harmful software that got on our computers |
| Phishing | Fake emails designed to trick people |
| Data breach | Unauthorized access to private information |
| Lateral movement | The attacker spread from one computer to others |
| C2 / Command and Control | The attacker's way of controlling infected computers |
| Credential compromise | Passwords were stolen |
| Patch / Update | A fix for a known security weakness |
| Firewall | A digital barrier that blocks unauthorized access |
| Encryption | Scrambling information so only authorized people can read it |
| MFA / Two-factor | Requiring two proofs of identity (like password + phone code) |

### What Executives Need vs. What They Don't

::: {.needs-table}
| **Executives Need** | **Executives Don't Need** |
|---------------------|---------------------------|
| Scope of impact | Detailed log analysis |
| Timeline of key events | Every technical step taken |
| Current risk status | IP addresses and hashes |
| Resource requirements | Tool names and versions |
| Decisions to make | MITRE ATT&CK framework details |
| Talking points for stakeholders | Forensic methodology |
:::

## Grade Band Variations

### Grades 6-8: Simplified Briefing

**Modified Challenge**: Write a "3-Sentence Summary" for the principal:

1. **What happened** (one sentence)
2. **What we did about it** (one sentence)
3. **What happens next** (one sentence)

Then write **one talking point** the principal could use if a parent asks.

### Grades 9-12: Full Executive Briefing

Complete the full one-page template. Additional challenge: Present the briefing orally in 90 seconds.

### Advanced Extension: Role-Play Presentation

One student presents the briefing while another plays Principal Martinez, asking clarifying questions:

- "Can you explain that in simpler terms?"
- "What should I tell parents?"
- "Do we need to spend money on this?"
- "How do we prevent this from happening again?"

## Evaluation Criteria

### Executive Briefing Rubric

| Criterion | Developing (1-2) | Proficient (3) | Advanced (4) |
|-----------|------------------|----------------|--------------|
| **Clarity** | Technical jargon remains | Mostly accessible language | Completely jargon-free without losing accuracy |
| **Completeness** | Missing key sections | All sections addressed | Anticipates questions not asked |
| **Actionability** | Unclear what executive should do | Clear decisions identified | Specific, prioritized recommendations |
| **Accuracy** | Simplification loses important details | Technical accuracy preserved | Complex ideas simplified elegantly |
| **Professionalism** | Informal tone/format | Professional presentation | Executive-ready document |

### Assessment Connection

| Rubric Criterion | Developed Through | Evidence Source |
|------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Communication Quality** | Translation from technical to plain language | Briefing document clarity score |
| **Audience Analysis** | Adapting content for Principal Martinez | Appropriateness of detail level |
| **Professional Judgment** | Deciding what to include/exclude | Completeness vs. brevity balance |
| **Synthesis Quality** | Distilling complex investigation | Quality of summary section |

**Applicable Rubrics**: [Decision-Making Quality Rubric](../../assessments/decision-making-quality-rubric.qmd)

## Career Connection

### Why This Matters

Security practitioners often encounter what might be termed the communication ceiling: technical skills secure initial employment, but communication skills determine professional advancement. Numerous talented security professionals experience career plateaus not from technical limitations but from difficulty explaining their work to organizational leaders who lack technical backgrounds.

The real-world context reinforces this pattern across multiple dimensions. Chief Information Security Officers allocate more professional time to communication activities than to technical analysis. Board-level presentations directly determine security budget allocations. Effective incident response necessarily encompasses stakeholder communication alongside technical remediation. Career advancement into leadership roles requires the capacity to exercise influence well beyond the Security Operations Center.

### NICE Framework Alignment

This activity develops competencies essential to progression from technical roles into management positions. The relevant NICE Framework v2.0.0 work roles include Systems Security Management (Oversight and Governance) with its emphasis on executive communication, Cybersecurity Policy and Planning (Oversight and Governance) requiring sustained stakeholder engagement, and Cybersecurity Executive (Oversight and Governance) centered on strategic communication across organizational levels.

## Implementation Notes

### Connecting to Core Activities

When implemented following the Security Detective Teams activity, students translate their investigation findings into an executive briefing format, concentrating on what the principal genuinely needs to understand about the phishing incident to fulfill administrative responsibilities.

When implemented following the SOC Analyst Simulation, students prepare the executive briefing required in Phase 4 with deliberate emphasis on audience adaptation principles rather than content generation alone.

### Common Student Struggles

Students frequently struggle with calibrating appropriate detail levels. Over-explanation manifests when students include excessive technical detail; instructors should encourage students to ask whether the principal needs to understand how the finding was discovered or merely what was found. Under-explanation occurs when students oversimplify to the point of rendering the briefing operationally useless; the document must enable informed decision-making, not merely summarize events. Technical writing habits also carry over problematically, particularly through passive voice constructions. Encourage direct, active language: "An attacker accessed..." rather than "Access was gained by..."

### Facilitating Peer Review

Structure peer review around three evaluative questions: Could a reader without technical background understand everything presented? Does the reader know what decisions require attention? Could the reader use this information to address a parent's question?

## Low-Resource Option

If technology is limited, provide a completed "technical report" on paper and have students create the executive briefing translation using pen and paper. The core skill—audience adaptation—doesn't require technology.

::: {.sample-technical-report}
**Sample Technical Input**:
> Analysis of network logs revealed anomalous authentication patterns consistent with credential stuffing attack. Initial access vector identified as spearphishing email (T1566.001) delivered to finance department at 14:23 UTC. Subsequent lateral movement (T1021) detected across 47 endpoints. C2 beacon established to 185.234.x.x with 20-second interval. Threat intelligence correlation indicates APT29 tooling with MANUFACTURING-AUTUMN campaign TTP alignment.

**Student Task**: Transform this into language Principal Martinez can understand and act upon.
