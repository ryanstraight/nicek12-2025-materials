## Teacher Overview

Students form response teams to investigate and solve realistic technology problems at their school. Each team member has a specific job, and they work with an AI helper to figure out what went wrong and how to fix it. This activity introduces the concept of incident response—what cybersecurity professionals do when something goes wrong.

**Duration**: 35-40 minutes
**Grade Levels**: 3-5
**Group Size**: Teams of 4 students
**Technology**: One device per team (or teacher-guided AI consultation)
:::

## Learning Goals

Students will:

- Understand that **different people have different jobs** during a technology problem
- Practice **working as a team** to investigate and solve problems
- Learn that **AI helpers are part of the team** but people make decisions
- Experience basic **problem-solving steps** professionals use

- Answers questions from other teams


## The Problem

::: {.scenario-box}
### Mystery at Maple Elementary!

**Read aloud to students:**

It's Monday morning at Maple Elementary School. Mrs. Chen's 4th-grade class arrives to find something wrong:

- The classroom computers are acting strange
- Pop-up messages keep appearing saying "CONGRATULATIONS! You WON!"
- Some websites they use for learning won't load
- The computers are running very slowly

The principal asks your team to help figure out what happened and how to fix it!

**Your job:** Work together to investigate the problem, find out what went wrong, and help Mrs. Chen's class get back to learning.

```

### Step 1: Gather Clues (5 minutes)

**Detective reads the Evidence Card to the team:**

::: {.evidence-card}
#### Evidence Card: What We Know

**Timeline:**
- Friday afternoon: Everything was working fine
- Monday morning: Problems started

**Clues:**
- Pop-ups say "Click here for your prize!"
- Mrs. Chen remembers a student clicked on an email last Friday
- Other classrooms are NOT having this problem
- The pop-ups have spelling mistakes: "Congradulations!"

**Questions to think about:**
- Why would only ONE classroom have this problem?
- What might have happened on Friday?
- Why do the pop-ups have spelling mistakes?
:::


### Step 2: Ask the AI Helper (10 minutes)

**AI Partner asks these questions** (one at a time):

**Question 1:**
> "We found pop-up messages on school computers that say we won a prize. They have spelling mistakes and appeared after someone clicked an email. What kind of problem is this?"

**What to listen for:**

- This sounds like malware or a computer virus
- The email was probably a trick (phishing)
- Spelling mistakes are a clue that it's fake

**Question 2:**
> "How do bad programs like this get on computers?"

**What to listen for:**
- Clicking links in tricky emails
- Going to unsafe websites
- Downloading things that look fun but aren't safe

**Question 3:**
> "What should we do to fix this problem?"

**What to listen for:**
- Tell an adult (teacher, IT person)
- Don't click on the pop-ups
- The IT team might need to clean the computers
- We can't fix it ourselves—we need experts

**Recorder writes down:** What the AI helper said about each question.


### Step 3: Make a Plan (5 minutes)

**Team discusses and decides:**

**What happened?**
- [ ] Someone clicked a tricky email
- [ ] A bad program got on the computers
- [ ] Something else: _______________

**Who needs to know?**
- [ ] The teacher
- [ ] The IT person
- [ ] The principal
- [ ] Other: _______________

**What should students do RIGHT NOW?**
- [ ] Stop using the computers
- [ ] Don't click the pop-ups
- [ ] Tell an adult
- [ ] Other: _______________

**What will the IT team probably do?**
- [ ] Clean the bad program off the computers
- [ ] Check if other computers are affected
- [ ] Help students learn not to click tricky emails
- [ ] Other: _______________


### Step 4: Report to the Class (10 minutes)

**Reporter shares:**

1. **What we found:** _______________
2. **What we think happened:** _______________
3. **Our solution:** _______________
4. **How AI helped us:** _______________
5. **What we would do differently next time:** _______________


## Class Discussion (5 minutes)

**Talk about as a class:**

1. **Why did we need a team?**
   - One person couldn't investigate everything alone
   - Different jobs helped us work faster
   - We caught things others might have missed

2. **How did the AI helper help?**

   - Knew about computer problems
   - Explained what the clues meant
   - But WE had to decide what to do!

3. **What's the big lesson?**

   - Don't click on emails or messages you don't expect
   - If something looks too good to be true, it probably is
   - When something goes wrong, work together to fix it


## Key Teaching Points

::: {.teaching-points}
### What We Learned

**Real cybersecurity teams work like this!**

- Different people have different jobs
- Everyone contributes something important
- AI tools help professionals investigate too

**When something goes wrong:**

1. Stay calm
2. Gather information
3. Ask for help from experts
4. Work together to solve it

**Prevention is important:**

- Be careful what you click
- If something seems wrong, tell an adult
- Mistakes happen—learning from them matters
:::


## Variations

### Simpler Version (3rd Grade)
- Teacher reads all materials aloud
- Whole class does investigation together
- Focus on 2 roles: Detective and Reporter
- AI consultation done by teacher

### Extended Version (5th Grade)
- Add more complex scenarios (see below)
- Students write their own AI questions
- Create prevention posters for other classes
- Present findings to another class

### Alternative Scenarios

**Scenario 2: The Slow Network**
> All the tablets in the library are running super slowly. Videos won't load and websites keep timing out. What's wrong?

**Scenario 3: The Missing Assignment**
> A student's project disappeared from the shared folder. The teacher didn't delete it. What might have happened?

**Scenario 4: The Strange Message**
> Students are getting messages from someone pretending to be their friend, asking for their password. How should they respond?


## Low-Resource Option

If no AI access is available, use these pre-written AI responses:

::: {.ai-response-card}
**About the pop-ups:**
> "Pop-up messages claiming you won a prize are almost always fake, especially if they have spelling mistakes. Real contests don't work this way. These are usually caused by malware—programs that got on your computer without permission. They often arrive when someone clicks a link in a tricky email."
:::

::: {.ai-response-card}
**About how it spreads:**
> "Bad programs like this usually get on computers in a few ways: clicking links in emails that look real but aren't, downloading games or apps from unsafe websites, or plugging in USB drives that have problems. Once on one computer, they can sometimes spread to others on the same network."
:::

::: {.ai-response-card}
**About fixing it:**
> "This isn't something students should try to fix themselves. The school's IT team has special tools to remove bad programs safely. The most important things students can do are: tell an adult right away, don't click on any pop-ups, and remember this experience so they can avoid tricky emails in the future."

>
> **What they learned:**
> - How to recognize fake messages (spelling mistakes, too-good-to-be-true prizes)
> - That clicking unknown links can cause problems
> - That teamwork and experts work together to solve technology problems
> - That AI can help investigate but people make the decisions
>

> - Who can we ask for help with computer problems?"


## Teacher Notes

### Connecting to Real Life

This activity mirrors what really happens in organizations:

- **Security Operations Centers (SOCs)** have teams investigating problems
- **Incident response** follows similar steps: identify, analyze, contain, recover
- **AI tools** are increasingly used to help professionals investigate

### Preparation Checklist

- [ ] Print Evidence Cards (one per team)
- [ ] Prepare role cards or badges
- [ ] Test AI access OR prepare response cards
- [ ] Create team recording sheets
- [ ] Plan team assignments

### Common Questions

**"Can we really not fix this ourselves?"**
> That's right! Some problems are too complex and need special tools. The smart thing is to know when to ask for help.

**"Why did the AI know what was wrong?"**
> AI systems have learned about many computer problems. But they can't actually FIX the problem—they can only help us understand it.

**"Could this happen at our school?"**
> These kinds of problems can happen anywhere. That's why it's important to be careful with emails and links!
