# AI-Assisted Incident Response
### Authentic Work Role Experience Through Team-Based Response
:::

::: {.callout-important .instructor-note}
## Instructor Overview
Students experience authentic NICE Framework Work Roles by responding to realistic security incidents. Each team member assumes a specific role while collaborating with AI as their technical analyst. This activity demonstrates how different cybersecurity professionals work together during actual incidents.

**Duration**: 50-60 minutes
**Grade Levels**: 6-8 (with role complexity variations)
**Group Size**: Teams of 3-4 students
**Technology Requirements**: One device per team minimum, ideally one per student
:::

## Learning Objectives

::: {.bento-grid}

## Incident Scenarios

### Scenario 1: The Ransomware Discovery (Beginner)

::: {.scenario-box .glass-card}
**Initial Alert**: Monday, 7:45 AM
Several teachers report they cannot access their lesson plans. Files show a ".locked" extension with a ransom note demanding cryptocurrency.

**Evidence Available**:
- Email logs showing suspicious attachment opened Friday afternoon
- Network traffic spike over the weekend
- 30% of school computers affected
- Backup system status: Last successful backup Thursday night

**Critical Decisions Required**:
1. Isolate affected systems or shut down entire network?
2. Contact law enforcement immediately or assess damage first?
3. Inform parents/community now or after initial response?
4. Attempt recovery from backups or negotiate with attackers?
:::

### Scenario 2: The Grade Database Breach (Intermediate)

::: {.scenario-box .glass-card}
**Initial Alert**: Wednesday, 2:30 PM
Anonymous tip claims student grades have been changed in the system. Initial check confirms several suspicious modifications.

**Evidence Available**:
- Unauthorized admin account created two weeks ago
- Grade changes pattern: All failing grades changed to passing
- IP logs show access from multiple locations
- Student information potentially exposed

**Critical Decisions Required**:
1. Lock down grade system or maintain access for investigation?
2. Notify affected students/parents individually or mass communication?
3. Invalidate current grades or attempt to restore originals?
4. Involve student discipline process or focus on system security?
:::

### Scenario 3: The Social Media Threat (Advanced)

::: {.scenario-box .glass-card}
**Initial Alert**: Thursday, 11:00 AM
School social media accounts compromised, posting inappropriate content and threats. Posts going viral with media attention growing.

**Evidence Available**:
- Password reset emails ignored by staff
- Account access from foreign IP addresses
- Coordinated attack across multiple platforms
- Personal information of staff being posted

**Critical Decisions Required**:
1. Delete accounts or attempt recovery?
2. Issue public statement or stay silent until resolved?
3. Lock down all school digital assets or targeted response?
4. Legal action priorities: Criminal investigation or civil remedies?

### Phase 1: Initial Assessment (10 minutes)

::: {.response-phase .neumorphic-card}
#### Team Actions
1. **Read scenario briefing** as a team
2. **Assign roles** based on strengths/interests
3. **Individual role preparation** (3 minutes):
   - IC: List immediate priorities
   - SOC: Identify technical indicators
   - Threat Intel: Note attack patterns
   - Comms: Draft initial stakeholder groups

#### AI Consultation Prompts
**For IC**: "As my incident response advisor, what are the top 3 immediate actions we should prioritize for [scenario type]?"

**For SOC**: "Help me analyze these technical indicators: [list evidence]. What attack patterns do you recognize?"

**For Threat Intel**: "Based on these characteristics [list], what type of threat actor might be responsible?"

**For Comms**: "What key information should we include in our initial incident notification?"
:::

### Phase 2: Response Planning (15 minutes)

::: {.response-phase .neumorphic-card}
#### Collaborative Planning Process
1. **SOC Analyst** presents technical findings
2. **Threat Intel** provides attacker context
3. **Team discusses** response options with AI input
4. **IC makes** preliminary decisions
5. **Comms prepares** messaging strategy

#### Decision Log Template
| Time | Decision Point | Options Considered | AI Input | Final Decision | Rationale |
|------|---------------|-------------------|----------|----------------|-----------|
| T+5min | Network isolation | Full/Partial/None | [AI recommendation] | [Team choice] | [Reasoning] |
| T+10min | Stakeholder notification | Immediate/Delayed | [AI suggestion] | [Team choice] | [Reasoning] |
:::

### Phase 3: Response Execution (15 minutes)

::: {.response-phase .neumorphic-card}
#### Action Implementation
Teams execute their response plan while managing emerging complications:

**Complication Injections** (Instructor introduces at 5-minute intervals):
1. "Media has picked up the story - reporters calling"
2. "New systems showing signs of compromise"
3. "Parent group demanding immediate meeting"

#### Real-Time Adaptation
- Teams must adjust plans based on complications
- AI consultation for handling unexpected developments
- Document changes to original response plan
- Maintain role responsibilities while adapting
:::

### Phase 4: After-Action Review (10 minutes)

::: {.response-phase .neumorphic-card}
#### Team Debrief Structure
1. **What went well?** Role execution and teamwork
2. **What challenged us?** Unexpected complications
3. **How did AI help?** Specific contributions
4. **What would we change?** Lessons learned
5. **Career insights?** Interest in specific roles
