## Instructor Overview

Students operate as a Security Operations Center (SOC) team responding to a realistic enterprise security incident. This simulation mirrors authentic SOC workflows where analysts coordinate with AI-powered Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) platforms. Students experience the NICE Framework's incident response work roles while developing critical thinking about human-AI collaboration in high-stakes situations.

**Duration**: 55-60 minutes
**Grade Levels**: 9-12
**Group Size**: Teams of 4-5 students
**Technology**: One device per student recommended; minimum one per team
:::

## Learning Objectives

Students will:

- Execute **incident response procedures** aligned with industry frameworks (NIST, SANS)
- Operate within **NICE Framework Work Roles** during crisis response
- Leverage AI as a **SOC analyst partner** while maintaining human decision authority
- Analyze **technical indicators** and correlate evidence across multiple sources
- Practice **stakeholder communication** during active incidents
- Evaluate **AI recommendations** critically against organizational context

### CYBER.org Standards Alignment (9-12)

- **9-12.SEC.INC**: Incident detection, response, and recovery procedures
- **9-12.SEC.FOR**: Digital forensics fundamentals
- **9-12.SEC.MON**: Security monitoring and analysis
- **9-12.SEC.THR**: Advanced threat analysis

### NICE Framework Alignment

**Primary Work Roles:**
- Incident Responder (PR-CIR-001)
- Cyber Defense Analyst (PR-CDA-001)
- Cyber Defense Incident Responder (PR-CDA-001)

**Supporting Work Roles:**
- Threat/Warning Analyst (AN-TWA-001)

## Simulation Environment

::: {.scenario-box}
### TechCorp Industries Security Operations Center

**Organization Profile:**
- Mid-size manufacturing company (2,500 employees)
- IT infrastructure: Hybrid cloud (Azure/on-premises)
- Security stack: CrowdStrike EDR, Splunk SIEM, Microsoft Defender
- AI Capability: "SentinelAI" SOAR platform with automated detection and response

**Your Role:** SOC Team working the 7AM-3PM shift

**Context:** SentinelAI has flagged a series of alerts requiring immediate human analysis and response. As the human operators, you must interpret AI findings, make critical decisions, and coordinate response across the organization.

**Key Constraint:** SentinelAI can detect patterns and recommend actions, but all containment, escalation, and communication decisions require human authorization.

### Phase 1: Initial Triage (10 minutes)

**All Team Members:**
1. Review assigned evidence package
2. Document initial observations
3. Prepare briefing for team

**SentinelAI Consultation (Lead Analyst):**

> "Analyze these network patterns [paste logs]. What attack progression do they indicate? Map to MITRE ATT&CK framework."

> "Compare this hash and IP against your threat intelligence. What campaign does this align with? What typically comes next in this attack chain?"

**Key Decision Point:**
- **Authorize endpoint isolation?** 47 manufacturing workstations offline = production impact
- SentinelAI recommends: YES (93% confidence attack in progress)
- Human consideration: Shift change happening, 200 workers need workstations

### Phase 2: Analysis and Scoping (15 minutes)

**Lead Analyst Tasks:**
- Build attack timeline
- Identify patient zero and attack vector
- Assess scope of compromise
- Determine if data exfiltration occurred

**Threat Intel Tasks:**
- Research APT29 TTPs
- Identify likely objectives
- Predict next attack phases
- Assess attribution confidence

**IC Tasks:**
- Prioritize response actions
- Assess business impact of containment options
- Prepare leadership notification
- Coordinate team activities

**Communications Tasks:**
- Draft executive summary
- Prepare manufacturing leadership notification
- Document decision log
- Track timeline

### Phase 3: Response Execution (15 minutes)

**Critical Decisions Required:**

::: {.decision-matrix}
| Decision | Options | AI Recommendation | Business Impact | Risk if Delayed |
|----------|---------|-------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Endpoint Isolation | Full / Partial / None | Full isolation | High - production stops | Very High - data loss |
| Network Segmentation | Activate / Monitor | Activate | Medium - IT overhead | High - lateral movement |
| Credential Reset | Immediate / Scheduled | Immediate | Medium - user disruption | Critical - persistence |
| Law Enforcement | Notify / Wait | Wait for scope | Low | Medium - evidence |
| Executive Escalation | Now / After containment | Now | Low | Medium - trust |
:::

**Team must document:**
- Decision made
- Rationale
- AI input considered
- Human factors that modified AI recommendation

### Phase 4: Communication (10 minutes)

**Draft required communications:**

1. **Executive Flash Report** (for CEO/CISO)
   - Incident severity and scope
   - Immediate actions taken
   - Business impact assessment

   - Operational impact
   - Workaround procedures
   - Expected resolution timeline

3. **IT Staff Directive**
   - Technical containment actions
   - Evidence preservation requirements
   - Coordination instructions

### Phase 5: Debrief (10 minutes)

**Team Discussion:**

1. **What did SentinelAI do well?**
   - Pattern detection speed
   - Threat intelligence correlation
   - Attack chain mapping
   - Risk quantification

2. **Where did human judgment matter most?**
   - Business context interpretation
   - Stakeholder communication
   - Trade-off decisions
   - Ethical considerations

3. **What would happen without AI?**
