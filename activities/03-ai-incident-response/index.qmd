## Overview

Students assume team roles during realistic security incidents, experiencing firsthand how cybersecurity professionals coordinate with AI systems when time pressure demands rapid, coordinated action.

**Core Learning**: Incident response requires diverse roles working in concert, each contributing specialized expertise that complements AI-driven analysis. Effective response emerges from coordination, not individual heroics.

## Grade-Band Versions

### K-2: Fix It Team!

**Duration**: 20-25 minutes

Young students assume simple roles (Finder, Helper, Fixer, Talker) to solve a classroom technology problem, learning that teams with different jobs work together to address challenges.

### Grades 3-5: Computer Problem Solvers

**Duration**: 35-40 minutes

Students form investigation teams with defined roles to respond to a school computer problem. They discover that different team members contribute different skills, with their AI partner serving as one member of the team.

### Grades 6-8: AI-Assisted Incident Response

**Duration**: 50-60 minutes

Teams respond to realistic security incidents using NICE Framework-aligned roles. Multiple scenario options allow flexibility in complexity and focus areas.

### Grades 9-12: SOC Analyst Simulation

**Duration**: 55-60 minutes

An enterprise-level breach scenario with technical depth. Students experience the pressure and coordination demands characteristic of Security Operations Center work during an active incident.

## NICE Framework Alignment

**Primary Work Roles**: Incident Responder (PR-CIR-001), Cyber Defense Analyst (PR-CDA-001), and Security Operations Center Analyst

**Skills students practice**: Incident triage, response coordination, automated threat detection integration, incident containment, and stakeholder communication

## Learn More: How Real SOCs Work

Security Operations Centers coordinate human analysts with AI-powered detection systems under intense time pressure—exactly what students experience in this activity. The NICE Framework defines these work roles precisely, and research on team-based cybersecurity learning shows that role-playing incident response builds lasting understanding of coordination dynamics.
