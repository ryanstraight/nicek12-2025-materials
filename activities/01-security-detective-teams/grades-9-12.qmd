## Instructor Overview

Students investigate a realistic security incident at a fictional company, partnering with AI to analyze evidence. This activity mirrors authentic Security Operations Center (SOC) workflows where analysts coordinate with AI-powered security tools daily. Students experience the NICE Framework's Cyber Defense Analysis work role firsthand.

**Duration**: 50-60 minutes
**Grade Levels**: 9-12
**Group Size**: Pairs or small groups (2-4)
**Technology**: One device per group minimum; individual access preferred
:::

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this activity, students will:

- Conduct systematic security investigation using AI as an analytical partner
- Distinguish between AI pattern-recognition capabilities and human contextual analysis
- Apply investigation methodology aligned with industry SOC practices
- Connect activity experience to cybersecurity career pathways

### CYBER.org Standards Alignment (9-12)

- **9-12.SEC.INFO**: Information security principles
- **9-12.SEC.NET**: Network security and monitoring
- **9-12.SEC.DATA**: Data security and protection

### NICE Framework Alignment

**Primary Work Role**: Defensive Cybersecurity (Protection and Defense category)

- Analyze collected information to identify vulnerabilities and potential for exploitation
- Identify security implications and apply methodologies for incident analysis
- Determine tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of threat actors


## The Incident

::: {.scenario-box}
### Incident Brief: Apex Financial Services

**Company**: Apex Financial Services (500 employees, regional financial advisory firm)
**Date**: Thursday, 2:47 PM
**Alert Source**: Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system

**Initial Alert**: Unusual authentication patterns detected for multiple user accounts in the Finance department. After-hours access attempts, unusual geographic locations, and failed MFA challenges logged.

**Your Assignment**: As SOC analysts, your team must investigate this incident, determine the attack vector, assess the scope of compromise, and provide initial recommendations.

**Stakeholder Expectations**: CFO wants preliminary findings within the hour. IT Security Manager needs technical details for remediation planning.

### Phase 1: Individual Evidence Analysis (10 minutes)

Before consulting your AI partner, analyze each evidence piece:

**Technical Indicators**:
- What IP addresses are suspicious and why?
- What authentication anomalies do you observe?
- What does the email timeline suggest?

**Human/Contextual Factors**:
- What do the HR notes suggest about potential insider risk?
- Why might users have overridden email warnings?
- What organizational factors might be relevant?

### Phase 2: AI Partnership Investigation (15 minutes)

Engage your AI partner as a fellow analyst. Frame the conversation professionally:

**Recommended Opening**:

> "I'm a SOC analyst investigating a potential credential compromise at a financial services firm. I need your help analyzing the evidence and identifying attack patterns. I'll share the logs and indicators—help me build a timeline and identify TTPs. I'll add contextual factors you might not be able to assess."

**Investigation Prompts**:

1. "Analyze these authentication logs. What attack pattern do you recognize?"

2. "Cross-reference the email gateway logs with the authentication timeline. What's the likely initial access vector?"

3. "Based on the threat intelligence data, what threat actor profile or campaign might this align with?"

4. "What evidence would you want to collect next to confirm your hypothesis?"

5. "What's your confidence level, and what are you uncertain about?"

**Document AI Insights**:

| Question | AI Analysis | My Assessment |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| Attack pattern | | |
| Initial access vector | | |
| Scope of compromise | | |
| AI's stated limitations | | |

### Phase 3: Integrated Analysis (10 minutes)

**Synthesize human and AI analysis**:

1. **What AI identified well**:
   - Technical patterns (timing, IP correlation, TTP matching)
   - Threat intelligence correlation
   - Attack timeline reconstruction

2. **What required human analysis**:

   - Insider risk assessment (HR context)
   - Why users overrode security warnings (organizational culture)
   - Business impact assessment
   - Appropriate response considering employee relations

3. **Combined conclusion**:

   - Initial access vector: _______________
   - Compromised accounts: _______________
   - Scope of data access: _______________
   - Recommended immediate actions: _______________

### Phase 4: Incident Report (10 minutes)

**Draft Executive Summary** (for CFO):

> Incident Type: _______________
> Affected Users: _______________
> Data at Risk: _______________
> Recommended Actions: _______________
> Confidence Level: _______________

**Technical Findings** (for IT Security Manager):

> Attack Vector: _______________
> IOCs Identified: _______________
> Systems Affected: _______________
> Remediation Steps: _______________

## Career Connections

### This Activity Mirrors Real SOC Work

**In actual Security Operations Centers**:
- Analysts review alerts from SIEM systems (just like our scenario)
- AI/ML tools flag anomalies for human review
- Analysts add contextual knowledge AI lacks
- Teams coordinate technical findings with business stakeholders

### Related NICE Framework Work Roles

| Work Role (v2.0.0) | How This Activity Connects |
|-----------|---------------------------|
| **Defensive Cybersecurity** | Core investigation methodology |
| **Incident Response** | Escalation and remediation planning |
| **Threat Analysis** | IOC correlation and threat profiling |
| **Digital Forensics** | Evidence analysis and investigation |

### Career Pathway Discussion

- What surprised you about working with AI on security analysis?
- How would you describe the human analyst's value-add to someone considering this career?
- What skills would you want to develop to be effective in this role?


## Extension Challenges

### Advanced Technical Analysis
- Research the specific TTP "Legacy Authentication Exploitation" (MITRE ATT&CK T1078.001)
- Create detection rules that would have caught this attack earlier

### Incident Response Planning
- Draft a full incident response plan for this scenario
- Include communication templates for affected users

### Threat Hunting
- What proactive queries would you run to find similar compromises?
- Design a threat hunting hypothesis based on this incident

### Policy Recommendations
- What security policy changes would prevent this attack?
- How would you balance security with user experience?


## Instructor Notes

### Preparation
- [ ] Ensure AI access for all groups (or prepare detailed pre-generated responses)
- [ ] Print evidence packets or prepare digital distribution
- [ ] Review MITRE ATT&CK framework basics for context
- [ ] Prepare discussion of local career opportunities in cybersecurity

### Key Discussion Points
- **AI limitations**: AI doesn't know about the HR context, organizational politics, or why users made the decisions they did
- **Human judgment**: Deciding whether jmorris is a compromised victim or potential insider threat requires human assessment
- **Real-world complexity**: Actual incidents involve more ambiguity and incomplete information

### Common Student Questions
- "Would AI actually be used this way?" → Yes, SOAR platforms and AI copilots are standard in enterprise SOCs
- "How accurate is AI analysis?" → Varies; AI excels at pattern matching but struggles with context and novel attacks
- "What certifications relate to this work?" → CompTIA Security+, CySA+, GIAC GCIH


## Low-Resource Adaptation

If AI access is limited, use this pre-generated analysis:

> **AI Analysis Summary**:
>
> Based on the evidence provided, I identify a credential phishing campaign with the following characteristics:
>
> **Timeline Reconstruction**:
> - Nov 10: Typosquatting domain registered (preparation phase)
> - Nov 12: Phishing emails sent to Finance department
> - Nov 14 02:34 AM: Credential use from known malicious IP
>
> **Attack Pattern**: This matches a Business Email Compromise (BEC) precursor campaign. The attacker harvested credentials via phishing, then accessed financial data during off-hours to avoid detection.
>
> **Technical Indicators**:
> - IP 185.42.x.x: HIGH confidence malicious
> - Legacy auth bypass: Known exploitation technique
> - MFA bypass method: Indicates sophisticated attacker
>
> **What I Cannot Assess**:
> - Whether jmorris is victim only or potentially complicit
> - Why users overrode email security warnings
> - Organizational factors that enabled the attack
> - Appropriate HR/legal response considerations
> - Business impact relative to company priorities
>
> **Recommended Next Steps**: Preserve evidence, reset affected credentials, audit legacy authentication, interview affected users.
