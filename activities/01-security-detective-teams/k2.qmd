## Teacher Overview

This activity introduces the youngest learners to the concept that **people and computers work best as a team**. Using a simple classroom mystery, students discover that their robot helper (AI) is good at some things, and people are good at other things—and together they solve problems better!

**Duration**: 25-30 minutes
**Grade Levels**: K-2
**Group Size**: Whole class with teacher leading
**Technology**: Teacher device only (students do not need devices)
:::

## Learning Goals

By the end of this activity, students will:

- Understand that computers can be **helpers**, not just toys or tools
- Recognize that people and computers are good at **different things**
- Experience working **together** with a computer helper to solve a problem

### CYBER.org Standards Alignment (K-2)

- **K-2.DC.CIT**: Digital citizenship foundations
- **K-2.SEC.SAF**: Basic safety concepts


## The Mystery

::: {.scenario-box}
### Oh No! The Class Pet Picture Is Missing!

**Setup**: Tell students that the class computer had a picture of the class pet (real or imaginary) saved on it, but now it's gone! We need to figure out what happened.

**The Clues** (show on screen or as printed pictures):

1. 🖥️ The computer screen shows: "File not found"
2. 👀 Someone saw a student at the computer during snack time
3. 🗑️ The recycling bin icon on the computer looks full
4. 📝 There's a note that says "oops" near the computer
:::


## Activity Flow (25-30 minutes)

### Part 1: Look at the Clues (5 minutes)

**Teacher says**:
> "We have a mystery! Our class pet picture is missing. Let's be detectives and figure out what happened. First, let's look at the clues together."

Show each clue. Ask students:
- "What do you see?"
- "What do you think this means?"

### Part 2: Ask Our Robot Helper (10 minutes)

**Teacher says**:
> "Now, I have a special helper—a robot friend on the computer! The robot is really good at remembering things and finding patterns. Let's ask our robot helper what it thinks."

**Open your AI assistant** (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) and say to students:
> "I'm going to ask our robot helper. Listen to what it says!"

**Type this prompt** (read it aloud as you type):
> "You are a friendly robot helper talking to kindergarten and first grade students. We have a mystery: a picture file is missing from the class computer. Here are our clues: the screen says 'file not found', someone was at the computer during snack time, the recycling bin looks full, and there's a note that says 'oops'. What do you think might have happened? Use simple words."

**Read the AI response** in a fun "robot voice" if you like!

### Part 3: What Did We Each Figure Out? (5 minutes)

**Discussion questions**:

1. "What did our robot helper notice?"
   - (AI probably mentioned: recycling bin, accidental deletion, checking the trash)

2. "What did WE notice that the robot might not understand?"
   - (Humans noticed: the "oops" note suggests someone feels bad, someone was there at snack time, this was probably an accident not on purpose)

3. "Who solved the mystery—us or the robot?"
   - (Answer: BOTH! We worked together!)

### Part 4: Check the Answer Together (5 minutes)

**Teacher says**:
> "Let's see if we can find our picture! Our robot helper said to check the recycling bin..."

**Demonstrate** opening the recycle bin and "finding" the picture (pre-stage this).

**Celebrate**: "We found it! Our robot helper knew WHERE to look, and WE understood that it was probably an accident. **Together** we solved the mystery!"


## Key Teaching Points

### What to Emphasize

::: {.teaching-points}
**Robot helpers are good at**:
- Remembering where things are on computers
- Finding patterns
- Knowing computer rules (like "deleted files go to recycling bin")

**People are good at**:
- Understanding feelings (the "oops" note)
- Knowing about our classroom and friends
- Deciding what to do next

**Together**:
- We solve problems better than either one alone!

### Simple Vocabulary

| Word | Kid-Friendly Meaning |
|------|---------------------|
| Robot helper | A computer program that can answer questions |
| Clue | Something that helps us figure out a mystery |
| Pattern | When things happen the same way again and again |
| Team | People (or people and robots!) working together |


## Variations

### For Kindergarten
- Use only 2-3 clues
- Focus on the "together is better" message
- Skip the AI interaction and use a pre-written "robot helper says..." card

### For 2nd Grade
- Let students suggest questions to ask the robot helper
- Discuss: "What questions would you ask?"
- Introduce the word "partner"

### Low-Resource Option
**If you don't have AI access**, use this pre-written robot helper response:

> "Beep boop! I am a robot helper. I see the recycling bin is full—that is where deleted files go! I think someone might have accidentally put the picture in the recycling bin. We should check there! But I don't know who was at the computer or why they might have done it. Can you help me understand that part?"


## Follow-Up Activities

### Art Connection
- Draw a picture of "Me and My Robot Helper" solving a problem together

### Discussion Circle
- "When else might a robot helper be useful?"
- "What are YOU good at that a robot might not understand?"

### Take-Home Connection
- Simple note to families: "Today we learned that people and computer helpers work best as a team!"


## Assessment

### Observation Checklist

| Student Behavior | Observed? |
|-----------------|-----------|
| Participated in identifying clues | ☐ |
| Listened to robot helper response | ☐ |
| Contributed to discussion about human vs. robot strengths | ☐ |
| Expressed understanding that teamwork helped solve mystery | ☐ |

### Exit Ticket (for 1st-2nd grade)

**Draw or write**: "One thing I'm good at, and one thing a robot helper is good at"

### Assessment Connection

This table shows how activity elements connect to the [Human-AI Collaboration Rubric](../../assessments/human-ai-collaboration-rubric.qmd) criteria:

| Rubric Criterion | Developed Through | Evidence Source |
|------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **AI Partnership Framing** | Listening to robot helper as team member | Observation: Does student talk about robot as "helper" or "friend"? |
| **Complementary Strengths** | Discussion of human vs. robot abilities | Exit ticket drawing/writing |
| **AI Limitation Awareness** | Teacher emphasis on what robot couldn't understand | Verbal responses during Part 3 discussion |
| **Synthesis Quality** | "Together we solved it" celebration | Student articulation of teamwork message |


## Teacher Notes

### Why This Matters

Even our youngest learners are growing up with AI assistants (Alexa, Siri, Google). This activity helps them develop a healthy mental model: AI is a **partner**, not magic, and humans bring important things that AI can't do.

### Preparation Checklist

- [ ] Choose or create a "class pet picture" to "lose"
- [ ] Pre-delete the picture to recycle bin
- [ ] Test AI access OR prepare the pre-written response
- [ ] Print clue images if not showing on screen
- [ ] Practice your "robot voice" (optional but fun!)
