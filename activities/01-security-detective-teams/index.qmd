## Overview

Students investigate security incidents alongside an AI partner, discovering through hands-on experience that AI demonstrates strength in pattern recognition while humans bring irreplaceable contextual understanding. Together, they solve mysteries that neither could unravel independently.

**Core Learning**: AI excels at pattern recognition across large datasets; humans excel at understanding context and making judgment calls. Together, they achieve insights neither could reach alone.

## Learn More: Pattern Recognition vs. Contextual Understanding

This distinction—AI for patterns, humans for context—reflects how Security Operations Centers actually function. Research shows that effective threat detection requires both computational pattern matching and human judgment about organizational context. The detective metaphor helps students internalize this complementary relationship.

## Grade-Band Versions

### K-2: Mystery Helpers

**Duration**: 20-25 minutes

In this simplified version, young students work with a "helper friend" to solve a classroom mystery using picture-based clues. The teacher voices the AI partner, introducing the foundational concept of teamwork with technology helpers.

[View K-2 Version](k2.qmd)

### Grades 3-5: Locked Library Computers

**Duration**: 30-35 minutes

Students investigate why library computers keep getting locked. Working with an AI partner through guided prompts, they discover how AI spots patterns while humans understand the reasons behind events.

[View Grades 3-5 Version](grades-3-5.qmd)

### Grades 6-8: Security Detective Teams

**Duration**: 45-50 minutes

The complete investigation experience. Student teams examine evidence packets, consult AI partners authentically, and synthesize their findings to determine what happened in a school security incident.

[View Grades 6-8 Version](grades-6-8.qmd)

### Grades 9-12: Threat Investigation

**Duration**: 50-60 minutes

A Security Operations Center-style simulation with technical depth. Students analyze authentication logs, network data, and social engineering indicators while working with AI to conduct a comprehensive threat investigation.
