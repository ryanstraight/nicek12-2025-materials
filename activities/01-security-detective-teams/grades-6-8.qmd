# Security Detective Teams
### Discovering Complementary Human-AI Strengths in Cybersecurity Investigation
:::

::: {.callout-important .instructor-note}
## Instructor Overview
This activity positions AI as a **team member** with unique capabilities and limitations, not as a tool or adversary. Students work in pairs with an AI partner to investigate security incidents, discovering how human intuition and AI pattern recognition complement each other in real-world cybersecurity scenarios.

**Duration**: 45-50 minutes
**Grade Levels**: 6-8 (with differentiation options)
**Group Size**: Pairs or small groups (3-4 students)
**Technology Requirements**: At least one device per group with internet access
:::

::: {.callout-note}
## Implementation Timeline

**First Time Teaching This Activity**: ~90 minutes prep

- Review materials & try AI prompts yourself (30 min)
- Print evidence packets & worksheets (15 min)
- Set up devices & test AI access (15 min)
- Pre-teach vocabulary: incident, pattern recognition, credential (30 min, day before)

**Subsequent Uses**: ~30 minutes prep

- Print materials & refresh on scenario (15 min)
- Quick device check (15 min)

**Pro Tip**: Print evidence packets double-sided to save paper and mimic real "case files."

## The Investigation Scenario

::: {.scenario-box .neumorphic-card}
### The Case: Mysterious Account Lockouts at Cyber Academy Middle School

**Background**: Over the past week, several student accounts at Cyber Academy Middle School have been locked out due to failed login attempts. The IT department has gathered evidence and needs your detective team to investigate.

**Your Mission**: Work with your AI partner to analyze the evidence, identify patterns, and determine if this is a security incident or a coincidence.

**Evidence Available**:
1. Login attempt logs showing timestamps and usernames
2. Password complexity report for affected accounts
3. Social media activity from affected students
4. Help desk tickets from the past month
5. Network activity logs from suspicious time periods

## Student Investigation Worksheet

::: {.worksheet-section .glass-card}
### Part 1: Human Detective Work
**Before consulting your AI partner**, examine the evidence and record:

1. **Initial Observations** (What patterns do you notice?)
   - Time patterns: ________________________________
   - Account similarities: ___________________________
   - Password patterns: ____________________________

2. **Human Intuition** (What feels suspicious or important?)
   - _________________________________________________
   - _________________________________________________

3. **Questions for AI Partner** (What would you like AI to help analyze?)
   - _________________________________________________
   - _________________________________________________
:::

::: {.worksheet-section .glass-card}
### Part 2: AI Partnership Investigation

**AI Interaction Protocol**: Frame your AI as a team member, not a search engine.

::: {.callout-warning}
## What AI Can and Can't Do

**AI is GOOD at** (share Documents A, B, D with AI):

- Finding patterns in structured data (login timestamps, IP addresses)
- Identifying password complexity issues
- Recognizing known attack signatures

**AI is NOT good at** (YOU analyze Document C):

- Understanding WHY someone posted on social media
- Reading social context and intentions
- Knowing if birthday posts are innocent or oversharing

**HUMANS are NOT good at** (Why you NEED AI):

- Processing thousands of data points quickly
- Spotting subtle patterns across large datasets
- Maintaining consistent attention to every detail
:::

::: {.callout-tip}
## The Partnership Insight

Neither partner is "better" than the other. Each has genuine strengths AND genuine limitations. Real cybersecurity professionals succeed by knowing when to rely on which capabilities—including knowing their own limitations.
:::

**Suggested Opening Prompt** (for structured data only):
> "You're my cybersecurity investigation partner. We're analyzing account lockouts at a middle school. Here's the login log data and network observations: [share Documents A, B, D]. What patterns do you see in this structured data?"

**Record AI Insights**:

1. Patterns AI identified in structured data: __________________________
2. Additional questions AI raised: __________________
3. What AI said it COULDN'T analyze: ____________________
:::

::: {.worksheet-section .glass-card}
### Part 2B: Mutual Accountability Check

**Critical Thinking Checkpoint**: Good partnerships involve mutual accountability. Before acting on your combined findings:

| AI Finding | How would you verify this? | What other sources should you check? | What if AI is wrong? |
|-----------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------|
| | | | |
| | | | |
| | | | |

**Key Questions**:

1. Did AI explain its reasoning, or just give an answer? ________________
2. Could you confirm AI's pattern detection by looking at the data yourself? ________________
3. What's the WORST that could happen if you act on AI's analysis without verifying? ________________
:::

::: {.worksheet-section .glass-card}
### Part 3: Team Synthesis

**Combining Human + AI Strengths**:

| Investigation Aspect | Human Strength | AI Contribution | Combined Insight |
|---------------------|---------------|-----------------|------------------|
| Structured Data (Docs A, B, D) | Verify AI findings | Pattern detection | |
| Social Context (Doc C) | Understand intentions | *Cannot do this* | |
| Ethical Considerations | Judge right/wrong | Identify options | |
| Taking Action | Bear ethical responsibility | Inform the decision | |

**The Key Insight**: Neither could have solved this alone. AI contributed _____________, humans contributed _____________, and TOGETHER we discovered _____________.

:::
:::

### Common Challenges & Solutions

::: {.callout-tip .instructor-guidance}
## Troubleshooting Guide

**Challenge**: Students treat AI like Google
- **Solution**: Model team member language, emphasize conversation vs. search

**Challenge**: AI provides incorrect analysis
- **Solution**: Use as teaching moment about AI limitations, emphasize human verification

**Challenge**: Students skip the verification step
- **Solution**: Require completed Part 2B before moving to synthesis; ask "How do you KNOW AI is right?"

**Challenge**: AI claims to analyze social context (Document C)
- **Solution**: Point out that AI is guessing—it can't actually see social media posts or understand context

**Challenge**: Limited device access
- **Solution**: Rotate devices, use teacher demonstration, prepare printed AI responses

**Challenge**: Students over-rely on AI
- **Solution**: Enforce "human first" investigation phase, require justification for AI consultation
:::

## Debrief Framework

### Whole-Class Discussion Questions

::: {.discussion-guide .glass-card}

**Discovery Questions**

Begin the debrief by exploring what students learned about human-AI collaboration. Ask what insights emerged that neither human nor AI would have found alone. Encourage students to articulate what humans contributed that AI could not and vice versa. Explore how the partnership created something new rather than simply combining separate contributions.

**Work Role Connections**

Help students connect their experience to real cybersecurity careers. Discuss how a real SOC Analyst would partner with AI in their daily work. Explore what unique human capabilities matter in cybersecurity and what unique AI capabilities prove most valuable. Ask which NICE Framework Work Roles interest students after completing this activity.

**Critical Thinking**

Probe deeper into the complexities of human-AI collaboration. Ask who bears responsibility when a human-AI team makes a mistake. Discuss how professionals build trust in their AI partners while maintaining accountability. Explore the ethical considerations that arise when humans and AI share decision-making responsibilities. Ask whether AI ever suggested something that seemed wrong or incomplete, and how students handled that situation. Consider what would happen if organizations relied only on AI without human review.

**Real-World Application**

Connect the activity to authentic professional practice. Ask how real SOC analysts decide when to trust an AI alert versus investigate further. Discuss when it might be appropriate to override an AI recommendation and when one should trust it. Explore what skills students need to develop to become effective human partners to AI systems.
